HOW TO CREATE DARK WORLDS 
AN AUTHOR'S GUIDE TO WORLDBUILDING
HORROR, DARK FANTASY, AND GRIMDARK
A TREVENA



INTRODUCTION
I am one of those authors who have been writing, pretty much, since they were old enough to hold a pen. I have a folder of old stories,
typed up on an old typewriter, that I don't even remember having written.
I was rarely seen without a book in my hand, and spent every spare hour I had buried deep in fantastical worlds. I was lucky that my
parents encouraged it. They never told me that I was wasting my time, or to keep my head out of the clouds. They even let me read at
the dinner table, eating one-handed.
I was also lucky to have access to a local library, and quickly worked my way through the fantasy catalogue in their children's section. I
swept my way through all of the Choose Your Own Adventure books; not only following the adventures of kids—passing into a fantasy
world to ﬁght dragons, mounted on their bicycle steeds—but I got to control the stories. I could re-read them over and over, choosing
different paths each time, creating a multitude of adventures for myself.
My love of speculative ﬁction had started young. It was my dad's job to read the bedtime stories each night, all of us huddled together
to listen. He often picked books from his own collection which, almost exclusively, consisted of classic sci-ﬁ novels. And so, as a child,
my bedtime stories were written by the likes of I-I.G. Wells and John Wyndham. Looking back, I suspect that The War of the Worlds and
The Day of the Triﬂids were probably inappropriate choices for children about to go to sleep, but it must have caught my imagination. I
will forever thank my dad for introducing me to such tales.
At university I studied Drama and Creative Writing, and wandered away from my love of magic and fantastical worlds. I can't say why,
it just happened. Perhaps I felt pressure to ﬁnally grow up. Perhaps I felt the oncoming cynicism of adulthood. Perhaps my university
course pushed me towards literary ﬁction. Perhaps I simply needed a break from it for a while. I don’t know.
After university, as I began to navigate the confusing and cynical world of adulthood, I barely read anything at all. For a long time, I
hardly managed a handful of books a year. During this time, I read my ﬁrst ever Stephen King book. It was, interestingly enough, On
Writing that I picked up ﬁrst, and I ﬁnished it in just a few days. And so, I was brought back to literature with a renewed desire to read,
as well as to write.
While this was my ﬁrst reading of a Stephen King book, it certainly wasn't my ﬁrst reading of horror. I’m not sure when I was ﬁrst
introduced to the genre, or whether it was through books or through ﬁlm. Of course, a lot of books read to very young children contain
elements of horror. Whether as the original folk and fairy tales told orally at bedtime, or as modern picture books, children have always
been told stories that contain horror elements. And I certainly see that in a lot of my favourite childhood books. But, if we focus on my
teenage years, when I can actually remember falling in love with the genre, it was my younger brother who introduced me to the 1 9 70s
and 1980s cult horror movies such as Nightmare on Elm Street and Killer Klawnsfrom Outer Space. And it was a school friend who lent



me horror novels. Though I forget the title and author, I remember a particularly graphic pulp novel about a giant killer crocodile that
I hid in the recess below my bottom drawer for fear of my mother discovering it.
Since then, I've been absolutely fascinated by the horror genre—and have worked my way through far, far more Stephen King titles! I
love the huge variety of horror sub and niche genres, and I ﬁnd it really interesting how much horror trends are a result of our shifting
culture and world events, capturing whatever fear is gripping society at the time.
My writing career actually started out in horror. While I've shifted more to dystopian and post-apocalyptic ﬁction, my writing still
pays homage to horror in every way it can. I started my publishing journey by writing horror short stories for anthologies published
by small and independent presses. There are stories of mine out there ranging from gothic ghost stories to zombie erotica. Oh, yes. It's
actually true.
Although I've been writing since I was very young, it was never actually my ambition to make a career from it. I wanted to act. I wanted
to be on stage. My whole childhood was ﬁlled with drama lessons, singing lessons, lessons in several different forms of dance. I was al-
ways performing; music concerts, amateur dramatics, school plays. If there was a spotlight, I was in it.
While I was at university, studying Drama, I discovered that I wasn't enjoying it as much as I'd expected to. I had a long heart-to-heart
with myself, ﬁnally accepting that the ambition I'd had all of my life, my singular goal, simply wasn't what I wanted anymore. And it
was difﬁcult to let go of. This vision had shaped my entire life, my entire personality, and I had nothing to replace it with.
But, I couldn't pretend to myself anymore. And, as I continued with my degree, I came to the conclusion that I didn't want to be onstage,
blinking into the spotlight, speaking someone else's words. What I wanted was to sit in the back of a darkened auditorium, watching
other people perform my words. I wanted to write.
Even with this revelation, I still didn't imagine myself making writing into any kind of a career. The ﬁrst Kindle wouldn't come on the
market for another six years. The publishing landscape was a very different one to what it is today. Becoming a published author was a
pipe-dream. One that seemed to rely far more on luck than any kind of talent. A who-you-know rather than a what-you-know industry.
And for a young woman barely into her twenties, and still reeling from losing the footing of the one constant she'd had in her life, it all
seemed like an impossibility.
As part of my Creative Writing class, our tutor asked us to write a personal introduction to an imaginary book about ourselves. Much
like this introduction you're reading right now. The difference being, in that imagined introduction, I wrote "I can't imagine writing
ever being anything more than a hobby for me." When our assignments were returned, my tutor had highlighted that sentence, re-
sponding with the note “That would be a shame." That single comment began a shift in mindset which, over the following years, led
me to this moment right now. And this book, through all those that have come before it.
Inspiration tends to come from the most unexpected sources, at the most unexpected of moments.



And I'm sure that my tutor has no idea of the impact she had. Of the wheels she set into motion. Of the future she helped to craft. She
dropped a small pebble into a pool, and its ripples are still radiating outwards.



USING THIS GUIDEBOOK
If you’re looking to write horror or dark fantasy ﬁction for the ﬁrst time, and you're not sure where to start, this is the book for you.
If you'd like to deepen and expand your idea for a bleak, grimdark world, this is the book for you. If you ﬁnd the idea of these genres
daunting, and you've been putting off starting to write, this is deﬁnitely the book for you.
This guidebook breaks the genres down, exploring the worldbuilding and ideas behind them. It will lead you through the process of
creating a strong, solid basis for your world, characters, and story. It will help you to understand your readers’ expectations, as well as
showing you how those expectations can be twisted, upended, and smashed.
This book and its prompts are not, by any means, exhaustive. Depending on your story, your characters, and the world you need to
create for them, you may need to continue worldbuilding beyond the scope of this workbook. Likewise, not all of this book will neces-
sarily be relevant to your speciﬁc story.
Think of it like a garden. This book gives you the foundation to build upon. It helps you to plant the seeds, and offers you seeds you may
not have considered planting yourself. But, you'll need to cultivate it, and water it. And, you may have plants of your own that you want
to include. A special tree, your favourite ﬂower. You may like to have a pond, or a bench, or a marquee.
This guidebook is packed with direct questions to answer, so you'll need a notebook or open document to write your answers in. You'll
also want to note down all of those ideas that don't quite belong. Not yet, at least. When you come to writing your story, keep your
notes next to you, so that all the things you need to know about your story are in easy reach.
Above all, enjoy creating your dark and shadowy world. Enjoy exploring it, and watching it come to life around you. I promise; even if
you're building the darkest of worlds, the most terrifying of realms, you'll enjoy it. Even if only in a malicious, vengeful God-like kind
of way!
As a simple human, this may be the closest you'll come to performing real magic. To visualise an entire world from nothing. To pluck
things from the air and make them real. To take breath on the wind and form it into something tangible. That is the most real, purest
magic I know of.
Of course, I'm being presumptuous here. You may have magical abilities beyond my comprehension. In fact, you may even be a little
more than human...



WORLDBUILDING BASICS
While fantasy and science-ﬁction authors may be doing the heavy lifting when creating their ﬁctional worlds, worldbuilding exists in,
pretty much, every genre. To a certain extent.
Whether it's the creation of an imaginary cafe in a real town, or imagining an alternative outcome to an event from history, any book,
of any kind, can involve worldbuilding. At the fantasy, sci-ﬁ, and horror end of the scale, the worldbuilding-heavyweights, it may mean
the creation of a magic system or monsters to slot alongside the real world. Or it may mean building an entirely new world with new
species and cultures, right up to an entire universe of planets.
It can become quite the epic task!
Now, I don't know about you, but I tend to get easily overwhelmed by epic tasks. That's why I'm still working up to de-cluttering my
house. I just look at the job as a whole, can't untangle where to actually start, and I end up doing nothing at all.
As much as I understand the usefulness and the importance of breaking things down into workable chunks, into simple steps, the
ability and method for doing this very often escapes me. Unlike many other people, I can see the wood very clearly. It's the trees I have
trouble with.
And this is what this workbook is designed to do. It breaks the task of building a fully ﬁctional world into sizeable chunks. Worldbuild-
ing doesn't need to be difﬁcult, or complicated. It doesn't need to take forever, or be an excuse for never actually writing the book. It
doesn't need to be overwhelming or intimidating. At the other end of the scale, it shouldn't be something that you haphazardly bolt on
in a last-minute panic.
As you'll discover through this book, worldbuilding should be tightly integrated with your plot and your characters. Your characters
and their goals, their struggles, their journey, are the reason your readers show up. That's the reason they keep reading. You can have
the most amazing world, but if you don't populate it with compelling, sympathetic, and relatable characters, readers will simply stop
turning the pages. Likewise, if you write amazing characters, and put them into a ﬂat, paper world, your readers won't want to walk
along with them, or explore with them.
Just as you want your readers to believe in your characters, you want them to believe in your world, too.
Let them smell the salt on the breeze, hear the buzzing of the insects. Let them feel the fear of the approaching monster, and feel its hot
breath on their neck. Let them walk every single step with your characters. Invite them in. And invite them to stay. Whether they want
to set up home there, or ﬁght to change it.



Your worldbuilding is equally as important as your story and characters. Give your characters somewhere real to live, and give your
readers somewhere real to visit. You simply can't separate these things out if you want to write the best book that you can.
So, what are you waiting for? Let's get started with the basics of worldbuilding.
DIFFERENT TYPES OF WORLDBUILDING
There are a few different ways to approach worldbuilding, and which you choose, will depend on your goals, your story, and your
genre.
Building a whole new ﬁctional world:
This method involves creating an entirely ﬁctional world from scratch. Somewhere that does not, and never has, existed. It may have
similarities to our world, and it may have huge differences. Think along the lines of second-world fantasies penned by the likes of ].R.R.
Tolkien or C.S. Lewis. You may well choose this option if your book is going to be more on the fantasy side.
A real place with an alternative past or future:
The other way is to set your story in a real place, and have a ﬁctional world created alongside it, usually invisible or hidden from the
general public. Such as in Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere, or Percy jackson, or I-Iellboy. The ﬁctional side of the world may be tightly inte-
grated with the real world, or it may be quite separate. This would depend, again, on your story.
A real place with a parallel ﬁctional world:
This may be taking a real existing place, London, for example, and giving it an alternative or altered history. Imagine if the Great Fire
of London had actually been started by dragons. How would that change the world today? Or it may be taking the real-world place, and
throwing it into your imagined future.
Whichever kind of world you're building, your objective is still the same: to create a believable world that your readers can really
imagine walking around in.
MAP MAKING
One of my favourite parts of worldbuilding is making the map. You don't need to be an amazing artist; a child-like scrawl on the back
of an envelope is good enough, as long as it makes sense to you and prevents you from getting lost in your own world. Which, believe
me, is surprisingly easy.
Imagine your characters are travelling from A to B. If, in one chapter, B lies west of A and then, suddenly, it's south, your readers will
notice. Or if B is a coastal town one minute, and a village in the mountains the next, your readers will notice, and it will drag them out



of your story. Plus, they will love to call you up on it. They'll email you. They'll message you on social media. And they'll write it in their
reviews.
As an author, your job is to keep them in the story. To keep them believing in it. To blur out their real world, their real life, and construct
a new one for them, for as long as they're reading your book. Glaring inaccuracies will pluck them out of your world. Inaccuracies break
the illusion, and remind them that they are simply reading a story. That they're not a hero ﬁghting against a terrible foe. It pulls them
back to their own cold, harsh, boring reality. And no one wants that!
And so, at the writing stage, your world map is for you. If you're not conﬁdent in your artistic abilities, there are plenty of artists who
can create a stunning map to go into the front of your book. At this stage, the map is only for your eyes. Build it out of Lego, build it on
Minecraft, mould it from clay, or cake, or whatever. As long as it's useful to you (and you're not tempted to eat it!)
And don't make the mistake of simply draw a map and then randomly scattering towns across it. That doesn't happen, it’s not believ-
able. Towns are founded in speciﬁc places for speciﬁc reasons. The main reason being, of course, survival.
So, imagine you're choosing a place to establish a town. What do you need? What considerations do you need to make?
Fresh water SOUICEI
The most important and ﬁrst consideration. Have you ever noticed how many major cities have a river ﬂowing through them?
Varied food source:
Man cannot live by bread alone. Or cake, sadly. Their food source needs to be varied enough to keep them healthy.
Natural resources:
They need enough resources to be able to build their homes, and the things they need. They can also use these resources for trade.
Appropriate land for crops/animals:
The landscape they choose to settle in will hugely impact the kind of food and animals they fann.
Access and security:
Can they get in and out of their settlement easily while still keeping it protected from intruders?
Trade route:
Can traders visit their settlement? Is it on a major trade route, or will they have to rely on people making a special trip?
Predators:
What lives in the woods? Or the mountains? How do they protect themselves against it?



People, by and large, will choose the easiest option for their home, unless the beneﬁts outweigh the dangers or struggles. I-‘or example,
you might consider it foolish to establish a town in the middle of a dragon breeding ground. But what if just one dragon scale (which
could be naturally shed) would sell for a price that could feed a family for three months. Then, it may well be worth it.
NAMIN G PLACES
There are several different ways to name the places on your map. Remember that it's not just towns and cities you need to name.
Depending on how big your map is, you might be naming mountain ranges, rivers, forests, counties, countries, oceans, continents, or
even planets.
Just like places on your map aren't randomly placed, neither are they randomly named. They might be named after their founder, or
the landscape, or the natural resources, the wildlife, the river or mountain they're close to. They might be named after a local legend;
your place names can actually conjure up stories of their own.
Of course, you can backward engineer these things. You can ﬁnd the name for a place, and then create the reason it was named that.
Perhaps no one remembers. Perhaps it doesn't matter to you, or your characters, or your story. As I'll discuss in the next section, you
don't need a full and complete history for everything.
There are so many online naming generators. Simply do a search, and you'll ﬁnd countless. I have two that I favour:
- squid.org/rpg-random-generator
- seventhsanctum.com
HISTORY
Your current world is a product of everything that ever happened there, even if no one in your world still remembers. It's your job, as
the writer, to know. To remember what they can't.
I'm not saying that you need to plot out 5 million years’ worth of history. Unless you're into that. Some people are. But you deﬁnitely
need to know enough to understand why things are the way they are. To know enough to effectively create the world, its culture, and
values.
As people, we act according to our culture. And each culture is different. And there are variations in that culture. The things we value.
The things we see as rude, or polite, or unnecessary. The things we want, the things we avoid. Religion. Festivals. The way we treat our
elderly. The way we treat children. The kind of food we eat, and the way in which we eat it. The kind of jobs we do. The differences be-
tween rich and poor. The differences between high culture and low culture.



And these things change over time. Invading cultures. Migrating cultures. Important events. A war, or a natural disaster can hugely
change a place’s cultu.re. Changing what’s important to them. Changing the way they live their lives.
And you need to remember that every time something changes, it affects everything else.
There are different levels at which an event can occur.
International events:
Something that affects the entire world. Like climate change, population explosion, the sun dying, zombie apocalypse, etc
National events:
Something that affects the country or large area. Like an economic crash, natural disasters, death of a monarch, etc.
Local events:
Something that aﬁects a town or community. Harvest failure, ﬂood, local elections, introduction of a new predator, a new trade deal,
etc.
Individual events:
Something that affects one person or family. Bereavement, loss of employment, loss of home, births, marriages, a lottery win, etc.
It's obvious how an international event affects everything else. I'm sure a worldwide zombie outbreak would affect you and your fam-
ily. But what about the other way round?
So, imagine a family preparing for a wedding. They order a whole load of wine from the next village. That gives the farmer enough
money to ﬁnally live out his dream of buying a boat and exploring the seas. When the winter rains come, the lack of the vineyard on
the hillside causes a landslip which demolishes the mining town below, which leads to a shortage of minerals, which leads to a short-
age of coins, which results in an economic crash.
This is, of course, a somewhat extreme example, but it's an important thing to bear in mind. Think about the butterﬂy effect, and the
ripples you might be sending out.
Imagine your world as a pool. Every event, ever construct, every thing you change or create, is like dropping a pebble into the water.
Sometimes, the ripples last a few minutes. Sometimes, a few years. Spreading wider. Affecting more people. Sometimes, those ripples
last for centuries.



HOW YOUR WORLD AFFECTS CHARACTER AND STORY
You can also use your worldbuilding to create conflict. Remember that conflict is created when your protagonist’s goal is interrupted,
or opposed, and you can use your world to do that.
Perhaps the most obvious example is if the protagonist's goal requires them to break the law. But you can use other things too:
limitations of magic, social norms and expectations, gender roles. The landscape itself can become a physical barrier, or the weather,
or a lack of resources.
And you can use all of this in your worldbuilding to raise the stakes. To increase the tension.
Because your world doesn't exist separately from the people who live in it, and you should create it with those people in mind. They
will have opinions about everything. Beliefs, hopes, grievances. Things they love, things they hate. Things they want to change. Things
they ﬁght to change.
And these things will diifer based on all of their nuances: gender, age, class, religion, etc. So their opinions will be different to the
person stood next to them. They may even directly oppose one another. Conﬂict.
v
You have to remember that everything comes back to character. You have to remember that you aren t writing a story about a world
that happens to have people living in it. You are writing a story about people who happen to live in a particular world.
Worldbuilding. Story. Character. None of these is independent from the others.



THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TROPES AND CLICHES
There's a lot of pressure to be original in your writing. To be the ﬁrst person to think of an idea, or a story. To think of a character, or a
world for them. Let me say this: originality is overrated.
I've seen lots of writers stressing out because they've come across a book that, from the blurb, sounds like it might be quite similar to
what they're writing. I've seen writers almost abandoning their books because of it.
There will always be books with ideas similar to yours. With characters similar to yours. With themes, settings, story elements similar
to yours. But, and I can promise you this, there will never, ever be a book exactly like yours.
Why can I be so sure? Because you are unique. You are a product of everything that has ever happened to you. You're a product of your
culture, your upbringing, your experiences; both moments of joy and moments of pain. You are a product of every inﬂuence that has
ever impressed itself upon you: friends, relatives, teachers. Music, movies, books. Beautiful views, shocking news stories, and every
thought that has ever crossed your busy mind. There is no other single person on this planet that has had the exact same experience of
life as you have, in the exact same doses, at the exact same points.
All of this has created your view of the world. It has moulded your vision of it. And your view of the world, your position in it, is
entirely, utterly, and irrevocably unique to you. Iust as the world has created you, you will create your world. Unique to you. No one can
say what you want to say exactly how you would say it. Because they're standing over there, and their view is totally different to yours.
So don't worry about making your story entirely unique. Don't worry about ﬁnding a situation and circumstance that no one, in the
history of the world, has ever written about before. The likelihood is, that you won't be able to. It is far more important to focus on
telling your story your way. That is what is original. That is what makes it special. The way in which you tell the story.
In fact, if you come across other books that are similar to yours, especially if they are popular books, written by a world-famous author,
then rejoice. Because there is already a market for your book, and you already know exactly who to market it to.
And so, let's move on to the difference between tropes and clichés.
I'm sure you'll know that a cliché is an overused, trite, stereotyped phrase or idea which has lost its impact, ingenuity, and originality
through excessive use over time. Clichés are something to be avoided in literature. They are something that invite eye-rolls from your
readers. They have also been known to cause heavy sighing, groans, bad reviews, and, in the worst cases, an incurable impulse to stop
reading.



Clichés are viewed, by readers, editors, publishers, and other authors, as a dirty, shameful thing. Something whispered about around
corners, or poked at, laughed at. They can kill a book entirely.
Now, I am fully aware that, just a few paragraphs ago, I made the bold statement that ‘originality is overrated’. And, I'm also aware that,
if taken out of context, it can appear that I am now contradicting myself. That's another thing that will induce tut-tutting and head
shaking.
In my defence, here comes some more context for you.
People often toss clichés and tropes into a singular box, shake it up, and mix them together without any care. They seem to think that
they are exactly the same thing. And that they are both things to stay clear of. It's a little bit like assuming that all bacteria is bad, and
out to kill you. As we know from all of those odd yoghurty-type-but-not-quite-yoghurt drink adverts; there is ‘good’ bacteria and ‘bad’
bacteria. To be fair, I don’t know any bacteria well enough to make my own decision on which is which. I'll just accept that the author-
itative voice-over on such advertisements is not leading me astray.
Let's make this clear: tropes and clichés are very different things, and should be treated as such. However (it's never simple, is it?), there
is cross-over, and the line between them is a little shaky and blurry in places.
First, let's deﬁne what a trope is. For the sake of context (again), we’re going to ignore the literal, dictionary deﬁnition of a trope, and
apply it more widely in the way that it applies here.
Genre tropes are common and recurring elements of story, attributed to speciﬁc genres. For example, the elderly mentor or the chosen
one in epic fantasy. The possessed doll or the abandoned asylum in horror. The one true love or the roll in the hay in romance.
Some tropes border on horrible clichés, and some tropes will be so overused that they will become cliches. Condemned to the mercy of
the red editing pen.
Other tropes are much loved and enjoyed by readers. There are many, many readers who speciﬁcally seek out books containing certain
tropes because they enjoy reading them so much.
Now, of course, you can't please everyone. For every reader that loves a particular trope, there will be another who hates it, and avoids
all books containing it. That's ﬁne. You cannot please everyone. Let me repeat that, because it's important: you cannot please everyone.
If you have an idea that you can write a book that is universally and comprehensively adored by everyone, get it out of your head right
HOW.
Think of tropes as genre markers. As milestones along a route. You don’t need to pass every single one of them, and you can meander
off that main route any time you wish. In fact, you might like to borrow a milestone marker from another genre route. You might like
to mix them together. Or break them apart, and create some kind of mosaic from them.



There may be tropes that can bring your book down. That can risk making it fonnulaic and predictable. But, at the end of the day, it is
your job, as the author, to take a trope and do something new with it. To twist it, and play with it, and paint it a new colour.
So, don't think of tropes as being the same a clichés. They are genre markers that many readers look out for. They’re little breadcrumbs,
or promises to the reader that they will be reading a book they already know they'll enjoy.
Questions:
- What are your initial thoughts regarding tropes?



GENRE TROPES
The accolade of being the ﬁrst horror novel is often awarded to Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto published in 1 765, but people
have been telling scary stories to one another since the dawn of time. Scary stories are a great teaching tool for keeping people away
from danger; tell a child that there are ghosts or ghouls in the forest, and they'll stay away. Tell people that there's an escaped madman
or a serial killer on the loose, and they'll be more vigilant, and look out for their neighbours.
Dark fantasy and grimdark are more recent additions to the genre list. Gertrude Barrows Bennett, publishing early in the 20th Century,
is often recognised as the person to have kickstarted the dark fantasy genre as we recognise it today. Grimdark actually grew from the
world of tabletop gaming, inspired by the tagline of Warhammer 40,000: "In the grim darkness of the far future there is only war.”
What are these genres? As with any genre deﬁnition, it's diﬁicult to conclusively pin down, and everyone has slightly different ideas.
So, let me tell you how I would deﬁne them. I don't claim to be any kind of ultimate authority, so you are more than welcome to dis-
agree with my deﬁnitions.
Dark fantasy and grimdark are the intersection at which horror and fantasy meet. Horror is more focused on the victims, with the
monster shown to be exactly that: monstrous. Dark fantasy tends to focus more on the monster’s point of view. Often making the mon-
sters sympathetic. Humanising them, while still focusing on the fact they are not human. They are still monsters. Grimdark is where
the monster and the human meet. It tends to highlight the monstrous aspect of humans, showing that they are one and the same. Or,
indeed, that humans are more monstrous than the monsters.
Again, you are more than welcome to disagree with me and there are, of course, many examples of each genre that go against my
deﬁnition. But that's the wonderful thing about genres and subgenres; they're fluid and ever-changing, with colours that mix and
blend into one another.
Here are some of the common tropes found in horror, dark fantasy, and grimdark. You'll recognise many of them, and you'll be able to
apply them to the genre books, movies, and TV shows that you know. This list is by no means completely exhaustive, there are far more
tropes to explore than those I've listed here. Nor is this list static. It will keep changing, but this will give you an idea of the kind of story
elements you can use to hit those genre markers for your readers.
Many of the tropes here can be applied to more than one of these genres. There's a lot of cross-over between them.
You shouldn't be looking to include all of them, or attempt to shoehorn them, forcibly, into a story they don't ﬁt in. If something in this
list sparks off a great story idea, run with it. Or if you see a trope that you really enjoy, use it. And if one gets your head buzzing with a
new way of interpreting it, then that's awesome. This list is just a guide. You can choose none of them, or, indeed, use it as a list of things
to avoid. It's your book, and there's no right or wrong answer. Write the story that makes your soul feel alive.



SOME HORROR TROPES
Haunted House: A location plagued by supernatural occurrences, often tied to a tragic or evil history.
The Unreliable Narrator: A narrator whose credibility is compromised, leading readers to question the truth of the narrative.
The Ancient Curse: A curse that affects the characters, often as a result of their actions or the actions of their ancestors.
Cursed Items: Objects imbued with malevolent magic or doomed fates that affect those who come into contact with them.
Isolation: Characters are cut off from the outside world, heightening tension and vulnerability.
The Monster Within: The fear that the true monster may be oneself or a loved one, rather than an external force.
Gothic Atmosphere: An emphasis on mood and setting, featuring dark, brooding environments with a sense of decay.
Urban Legends and Folklore: Stories that tap into the fears and anxieties of speciﬁc cultures or societies.
Cabin in the Woods: A group of characters isolated in a remote location, often leading to their demise.
The Call is Coming from Inside the House: A realization that a threat is much closer than expected, often used to heighten tension.
Eldritch Aborninations: Creatures that defy the laws of nature and human understanding, often causing madness in those who en-

ANTI-HEROES, RELUCTANT HEROES, AND GREY MORALITY
For so many years, stories have been ﬁlled with the traditional hero archetypes. Brave, honest, true characters that ﬁght for good, and
fairness, and do so selﬂessly while making personal sacriﬁces. But there's a growing popularity for characters who straddle the line
between good and evil; heroes who are reluctant to embrace their destiny, and individuals who don't ﬁt the mould of a typical saviour.
And horror, dark fantasy, and grimdark are genres that absolutely embrace them.
Anti-heroes not only offer opportunities for compelling narratives with a refreshing departure from conventional heroism, but they
also embrace the truly multi»faceted persona, acknowledging that we all have the capacity for bad, just as we have the capacity for
good. And every shade of grey inbetween. These characters are ﬂawed, morally ambiguous, and often driven by self-interest or per-
sonal agendas. They have their own motivations and goals—just as every character shou.ld—and they choose to bend the rules a little
to achieve them. Arguably, these characters are far more relatable, believable, and even fun, for readers.
Create distinct ﬂaws and complexities for your anti-heroes that set them apart from traditional heroes. Whether it's moral ambiguity,
selﬁshness, or a dark past, these ﬂaws add depth and nuance to the character. Tie these traits to your story, forcing your character to
face their ﬂaws, or to overcome them, or to use them as an essential strength, in order to fulﬁl their ultimate goal.
And, of course, your characters don't live in a vacuum. They exist in a world that has imprinted upon them. A world that continues to
impact them, control them, and expect certain things of them. Things they're most likely unwilling to grant. Tie their anti-hero traits
to the world around them. Make them the square peg in the round hole of society. Make them reluctant to conform. Make them a rebel
that can clearly see, and speaks out against, the hypocrisies of the world. Or make them jaded, fatalistic, unwilling to use their energy
to try to make the world a better place. They didn't break it, so why should they ﬁx it? It's probably too far gone to ﬁx anyway, right?
Despite their questionable actions, anti-heroes have relatable motivations driving their behaviour. Whether it's a desire for redemp-
tion, revenge, or survival, understanding their underlying motives humanizes the character and adds depth to their arc. But their
motivations don't simply appear in their heads one day. They don't wake up one morning, suddenly sparked with a strong desire they
didn't posses the day before. While there is an inciting incident; the one event that changes everything, and sets them off on their jour-
ney, these will be feelings that were already bubbling away inside them, just waiting for the opportunity to rise up.
These motivations should be rooted in their past, or created by the world around them. Maybe they seek justice against someone who
wronged them, or want to save themselves from the consequences of a dark secret being revealed, or bring down an authority that
seeks to rein them in.
And, beneath their tough exteriors, anti-heroes are often plagued by vulnerabilities and insecurities. Revealing these vulnerabilities
allows readers to empathise with the character and adds layers to their personality. And their journey, and the world around them,



should pick at those vulnerabilities, and press on those insecurities like bruises. Your anti-hero should be pushed to face the parts of
themselves that they've been avoiding. Forced to either rise up above the things that plague them, or to discover that it's not a ﬂaw,
after all, but a strength. That it means that they are the only person able to complete this ultimate goal. That they were never broken at
all. Or, that they are broken, but it's those very cracks in them that make them who they are, and able to do what they do.
Anti-heroes are often classic reluctant heroes, thrust into heroic roles against their will or inclination, often grappling with fear, doubt,
or just a strong compulsion that this is not their problem.
They need to have clear reasons for their reluctance to embrace their new role as a saviour. Whether it's fear of failure, a reluctance to
leave their comfort zone, or just a desire for a quiet life, these motivations drive their character development. But, as they unwillingly
accept their new responsibilities, they should undergo signiﬁcant character development, evolving from reluctant individuals into
courageous leaders. Or, at least, less reluctant individuals!
Perhaps they feel like their ﬁghting and adventuring days are behind them. Maybe they think they've done more than their fair share
already. They might have withdrawn from society, taking on a hermitical lifestyle that they have no intention of leaving behind, pre-
ferring the simple company of chickens over people.
It might be that they are an unlikely hero, or view themselves as such. A child with no experience. A retired warrior without the
strength to lift their weapons. They might live in a culture that has impressed certain prejudices upon them; the idea that a woman
can't save the day, or an elf can't be the hero, or that they aren't physically able, or smart enough, or simply not hero material for what-
ever reason. Breaking free of a lifetime's cultural imprinting is not easy.
Unlikely heroes possess unique qualities or strengths, and by highlighting these, you can set them apart from traditional heroes and
make them stand out. You can use them to challenge traditional stereotypes and expectations, offering a fresh perspective on heroism.
Unlikely heroes are often ordinary individuals thrust into extraordinary circumstances. By celebrating their ordinary nature, you can
emphasise the potential for heroism in all of us, inspiring readers to ﬁnd courage in their own lives.
Morally grey characters operate across the full spectrum of shades between good and evil, often grappling with complex moral dilem-
mas. Whether they're driven by a desire for power, justice, or redemption, their conﬂicting motivations can create tension and interest.
By presenting characters with dubious moral compasses, writers encourage readers to question their own beliefs and judgments.
Writing compelling anti-heroes, reluctant heroes, and morally grey characters can create protagonists and character journeys that
resonate in unexpected ways. They challenge traditional storytelling conventions and character expectations, and offer fresh perspec-
tives on heroism and morality.
But, a word of warning. Your readers still need to root for your characters. They still need a reason to want to see them succeed. If you
make your character too snarky, too nasty, too annoying, your readers will ﬁnd no reason to like them. Balance their ﬂaws and weak-



nesses with attractive qualities. Perhaps they're incredibly skilled at archery, maybe they're really funny. They might be incredibly
kind to animals, or have a beautiful singing voice, or make the most scrumptious cupcakes. Let your readers ﬁnd a reason to like them,
even if they might be a lot less than perfect.

CREATING DYSTOPIAN WORLDS
In simple terms, a dystopian world is the opposite of a utopian one. Rather than being an ideal, pleasant place to live, it is a very
undesirable one, ﬁlled with inequality, oppression, and hardship.
Dystopian stories tend to focus on the relationship and differences between the powerful and the powerless. Those with a voice, and
those who are silenced. They tend to focus on oppressed and marginalised demographics, and their struggles for recognition, for
change, or simply for survival. To highlight the imbalance of power, dystopians tend to push the inequity to the extreme, pitching
the most powerful people against the most downtrodden. Pitching those with the lowest chance of success, against those who control
everything.
The split of power might run along lines of ethnicity, gender, sexuality, or physical ability. It might be the oppression of a particular
religious group. Maybe the line is between those with magical ability, and those with none. Perhaps it lies between different species,
such as elves and sirens, fae and humans. It might be the split between those who have inherited the ability to see in the dark, or
breathe under water, and those who have not.
Oppression might be in the way of removal of land and resources, lack of access to education, healthcare, ﬁnancial institutions, or
democracy. It might be through laws that outlaw certain practices, traditions, languages, or even the very existence of people. It might
be through the erasure of history and culture. It might be through forced labour, encampment, imprisonment, sterilisation, or geno-
cide. It might be through a mixture of these or, indeed, all of them.
Dark fantasy and, especially, grimdark, are genres that often play out in dystopian worlds or, at least, worlds with strong dystopian
elements. Because it doesn't need to be entirely bad. just as a villain might think of themselves as the hero of their own story, a
dystopian world isn't a dystopia for everyone. Or it might be a utopia from the outside. It might seem perfect. It might even be seeking
to right the wrongs of the past. It might have been built with all of the best intentions. However, when there are winners, there are also
losers.
But it’s not entirely devoid of hope, because dystopian stories are often about revolution. And it all starts with one character setting out
to make things better. A character reaching breaking point, where they either let the world swallow them up, or they ﬁnally stand up
and start ﬁghting back. Even though they have nothing more than a passion that burns in their soul.
For all its bleakness, I view dystopia as a genre of hope. In fact, I love writing dystopias, because there's nothing like taking the most
marginalised, persecuted character and facing them with insunnountable barriers, with unbeatable foes, and watching them succeed
nonetheless. Because if they can do it, there's hope for us too.
Questions:



Who has the power?
Who is powerless?
What resources and institutions are the powerless barred from?
How are their lives controlled by the law?
How else are they oppressed?
What is the breaking point?
How do they ﬁght back?



CORRUPTION AT THE TOP
A common theme found in grimdark stories is the corrupting nature of power. Whenever someone has more power than another,
it creates an unequal dynamic, with the relationship based on domination and subservience. Sometimes, that relationship can be
mutually beneﬁcial, and even positive. Groups work well with leaders and followers. With a select number of decision makers. And we
might hope that they make decisions that beneﬁt as many as possible, but what happens when they make decisions that help, mainly,
themselves?
A corruption of power doesn't need to only happen at a government level. This theme can be reﬂected and highlighted in different
relationships than the rulers and their subjects.
You might want to highlight power corruption through a magic system. Perhaps there is magic that is outlawed, but practised, secretly,
among the ruling classes. Maybe there is an unhealthy power divide between those who can perform magic, and those who can't.
Maybe certain people are barred from receiving magical training. Or there might be different levels of magic; high magic and low
magic. Perhaps high magic is taught in exclusive and expensive private schools, accessed only by the rich. Maybe low magic is more
earth-based, with people passing knowledge of herb and plant remedies down through the generations.
This corruption of power might be reﬂected through a corrupt police force, or through the military. Perhaps the authorities are known
for hiring brutish thugs into their ranks, who use the power of their position to satisfy their own prejudices and personal biases. Maybe
their superiors look the other way and shrug off their bad behaviour. Maybe they actually enable and approve of it.
You might choose to show corruption through an unfair education system, or one that teaches nothing but government propaganda.
Perhaps the teachers are overbearing disciplinarians, with their cruel temperaments reﬂecting a deeper rot running through the power
structures of your society. Or maybe you explore the theme of corruption through a religious institution, with self»interest and im-
morality running rife among its leaders.
It might be that your characters encounter some rogue players, people who abuse their power, but stand alone in their actions. Or, it
might be that their choices are indicative of a wider corruption in society. A rot that runs from the top down.
Maybe your characters uncover a deep-rooted lack of morality in a powerful institution, discovering evidence of embezzlement,
bribery, nepotism. Maybe they seek to expose it. Or to seek their own brand of justice. What will those in power do to keep their secrets
safe? What lengths will they go to keep hold of their privilege and power?
Questions:
- Which institutions are abusing their power?



How is this corruption evident?
How does the corruption impact society?
How does it impact your characters?
What do they choose to do about it?



CREATING APOCALYPTIC WORLDS
When most people think of apocalyptic worlds, they might imagine a dry, arid desert-like place, or an ice-covered, inhospitable
wilderness. They might think of dangerous, wild places where humans are left to scratch out a living, distrustful of anyone else. But I
don't want you to limit yourself to such images.
An apocalyptic world can sit at many different points along the doomsday timeline. Perhaps your world is on the verge of an
apocalyptic event. Maybe everyone knows it's coming, with some people urgently preparing for survival, while others live out their
wildest fantasies, s11re that there will be no consequences to come. Perhaps most people are continuing their everyday lives in blissful
ignorance or denial. Your world might be fresh out of the apocalyptic event, raw and reeling, still trying to ﬁnd its feet. Or your world
might be ten years past the apocalypse, or ﬁfty years, or a century. Perhaps society has rebuilt itself, perhaps it was forced to start over
from scratch, or maybe it sought to set right its previous mistakes by creating a world nothing like what came before.
Your apocalyptic world might not be barren and desolate. It might not be somewhere your characters struggle for survival. Regardless
of what it looks like, or what it has become, your characters might ﬂourish and prosper. They might ﬁnd their calling, or discover that
their set of speciﬁc skills and knowledge were exactly what they needed to survive.
So, don't limit yourself to a single possibility for an apocalyptic world.
Whenever you're creating a world, I will always urge you to understand its history. Any world, any culture, is a product of everything
that's ever happened to it. From the foundations of its religions and the historical battles it still marks (or mourns) the anniversaries of,
to the consequences of past political decisions and the ongoing beneﬁts of scientiﬁc breakthroughs, any world is a product of its past.
Sometimes, people think an apocalyptic event will wipe out all of that. That creating a post-apocalyptic world is like starting with a
blank slate. But, that's not the case.
For anyone who survives the apocalypse, they step into this new reality with all of their cultural imprinting, all of their previous ex-
pectations, all of their prejudices and biases still intact. They also step into it with trauma and grief. They will grieve the things they've
lost; from their family and friends, their normality, right down to hot showers and their favourite ﬂavour of crisps. If everything
you've ever known is ripped away from you, you might ﬁnd yourself grieving for the most seemingly insigniﬁcant things. But they're
signiﬁcant to you. Or, they allow you to process your loss on a micro scale, rather than having to navigate the grief of losing everything.
And it's not just individuals that come into this new world with their past mould still wrapped around them. Society does. Will people
seek to recreate the world they lost, or will they seek to create something entirely new? Potentially better? People tend to cling to the
familiar, especially when things become scarily unfamiliar. So, just because an apocalyptic event has happened, it doesn't mean that
the past is wiped clean.



Technology might be lost. Religion might be proven wrong. Scientiﬁc understanding might collapse. Language, economics, politics,
education, law and order. Any combination of the many institutions and infrastructures that make up a world might be lost, destroyed,
or eradicated. But the culture in which they were created will remain imprinted on the people of that society. Even if they rebel against
it, even if they seek to change it, even if it's left in tatters, it still remains. And it will inﬂuence, very heavily, the world your communi-
ties create for themselves.
So, when you’re creating an apocalyptic world, start in its past. What was life like before, and how does it inform what life has become?

- Where does your world sit on the apocalyptic timeline?
- What was life like before?

of the sun, etc)
- How have your characters adapted to survive?
- What aspects of their previous society and culture are still in place?
- What aspects of their previous society and culture have changed?
- What aspects of their previous society and culture have disappeared altogether?



ABANDONED PLACES
You may think of abandoned places as a trope in horror (abandoned insane asylums, haunted houses, etc), or as an obvious setting in
apocalyptic stories. Of course. But abandoned places are much more than empty corridors and crumbling walls.
You can have abandoned places in any genre, and they can be any place, and they may have been abandoned for a huge range of reasons.
Imagine a wilderness that people have handed back to nature. A sanctuary for animals and plants to re-wild and thrive beyond the
interference of humans. Perhaps they abandoned some villages and farrns, maybe entire cities, leaving them to be roamed by beasts,
and crumbled by vines and roots. It's not desolate or scary. It's a beautiful sanctuary, and a symbol of people working hard to exist
alongside nature in a beneﬁcial way. To be true caretakers of the planet.
Also, ancient civilisations may have left ruins behind. Historical ﬁngerprints of their time. Ancient temples, cathedrals, castles.
Perhaps these places are avoided, believed to be haunted, or to carry curses. Maybe they are protected and revered, or stripped of their
artefacts. They might even be repurposed and brought back to life.
Places are also abandoned due to the evolution and inevitable changes in society over time. A town that thrived on a local natural
resource might become a ghost town when that resource is used up, or no longer in favour. Economic pressures and the changing job
market often see people moving to cities in search of prosperity, leaving their villages half empty. A large industry might relocate or
close down, causing mass unemployment, forcing people to search for work elsewhere. And, as populations move, schools are closed,
hospitals, and churches.
Natural disasters can also leave places abandoned, or completely cut off. Or, events that humans had a hand in. Maybe they introduce
a new predator to control the local wildlife population. Maybe it ends up with a taste for human blood instead. A large area of land poi-
soned by a chemical spill. A village force»bought and ﬂooded to create a new reservoir. Or demolished for a new road or rail route.
Of course, we're looking at some speciﬁc genres here; horror, dark fantasy, and grimdark. So, perhaps an ancient curse has ﬁnally come
to pass, or an old ghost story previously dismissed as an urban legend, turns out to be true. Maybe your characters are forced to go to
this abandoned place to stop a prophecy from being fulﬁlled. One that runs deep in their bloodline. One that, despite their reluctance,
means that they are the only person who can possibly stop it.
Perhaps they are forced to return to a long-abandoned place to ﬁnd the one artefact they need to complete their goal. Even though
they know it will curse them the moment they touch it. Even though this place is ﬁlled with malevolent ghosts that their ancestors
wronged. Ghosts that have sworn vengeance to all born of that bloodline.



Your abandoned place—indeed, any setting—is so much stronger when it's tied to the story. When it's given a history, and that history
is allowed to plant offshoots in the present, in the form of myths, urban legends, or superstitions. When that abandoned place has an
impact. When it draws people to it.
It might be nothing more than teenage curiosity that brings your characters there. Armed with cameras, searching for the ghost of a
serial killer, or ghosts of their victims. It might be coincidence, as they stumble across an abandoned house while hiking. Looking for
shelter from an unexpected storm, or a rest after falling and twisting their ankle. Pushed inside by circumstances. By a choice between
exposure or the creepy building before them. Or a mine shaft, a shack, a cave attached to a mysterious maze of tunnels. Tunnels that
hum with the sound of distant chanting. Tunnels that are painted with strange symbols and images. Drawn inside as your readers
helplessly witness one bad decision after another.
And this place can become even stronger, even more powerful, when it's tied to your characters themselves. When they inherit the
crumbling castle from some distant aunt, or they set off into the woods for a secret party at their uncle's hunting lodge, only to uncover
a gruesome family secret. Perhaps they're following clues from their grandmother's diaries, looking to fulﬁl her dying wish, travelling
to a place that has been shut off from society. A place that throbs with ancient, forbidden magic that requires blood to power it. Blood
from one speciﬁc family.
Maybe your characters are seeking to rediscover a place that their ancestors were forced out of, to reclaim their ancient homeland.
Their birthright. Perhaps, once they ﬁnd it, the truth isn't anything like what they were led to believe.
Your characters might need to travel to an abandoned place as a rite of passage, to prove themselves, or to complete a challenge. They
might need to collect something from there, or return something. Perhaps the abandoned place throws everything they thought about
the world into doubt. Proving the existence of something they didn't believe in, or disproving their faith in something.
Abandoned places are a strong trope found in all of the genres we're interested in here. And they can be powerful places of transfor-
mation for your characters and their journeys. They can ﬁll your characters with hope, anger, determination. Or they can leave your
characters feeling as empty and desolate as they are.
By tying them tightly to the fate of your characters, to their pasts and to their futures, you are creating poignant, powerful locations
that you can ﬁll with atmosphere, confrontation, and turmoil. You can bring these locations to life. Even when all living things aban-
doned them long ago.
Questions:
- What is the abandoned place?
- How long has it been abandoned?



Why was it abandoned?
What stories are told about it?
What roles does it play in your story?
How is your character linked to it?



SLUM LIFE
One common story element, particularly in grimdark and dystopian ﬁction, is the focus on the marginalised characters. The stories
aren't about the opulent lives of the wealthy, they're about the daily struggles and torments of those pushed to the fringes of society.
Any demographic of people can be marginalised. The important action is to remove their power. To remove their control over their own
circumstances. And one easy way to do that, is by forcing them into poverty. To forcibly remove their land, their resources, and their
freedoms.
But poverty isn't simply a lack of money. Poverty also means a lack choices, opportunities, access, freedom, and agency. It means
having fewer choices about their living situation, their educational opportunities, their access to institutions such as healthcare. It
means having fewer choices for leisure time and, quite often, having less leisure time overall. People living in poverty depend heavily
on any meagre income they earn, which limits their options for career mobility, and makes them susceptible to oppression by those
who employ them or take care of them. Poverty limits their chances to change their situation for the better. To really grind it in, you
can also remove their access to democracy by taking away their power to vote, to protest, or even contact their leaders.
Take a look at the culture and social hierarchy of your world. Who has the power? And who do they wield that power over? Consider
why they would want to oppress and marginalise a particular group of people. Is it to control the labour force? Is it to gain access
to valuable land and resources? Is it a culture war, with those in control looking to eradicate altemative religions, philosophies, and
lifestyles? Perhaps they want to control the narrative of history, to paint themselves as the good guys, and marginalise the voices that
say anything different. It might be for no better reason than simply because they can.
In a dystopian narrative, whatever it is that has been taken from these people, they will seek to take it back. To take back their power,
their choices, their freedom. We're likely to see a triumphant revolution, which results in the toppling of the establishment, and the
dawn of a new, fairer era. In the grimdark genre, I'm afraid it's more about the bitter aftermath of victory and less about celebrating a
success. While your grimdark characters might achieve their goal, it's likely to have come at an almost unbearably heavy cost. The loss
of too many friends. The loss of society at large. The loss of your main character's morality, sanity, or humanity.
What kind of life are your marginalised people making for themselves? Are they organised, or are they divided? What kind of society
and subculture have they developed?
Also consider how closely they are policed. Do they exist under the constant gaze of a militaristic police force, or are they largely left
to their own devices, existing in spaces that have become practically invisible to the other classes? Are they kept at arm's length, or
watched closely?



Many elements of their own subcultures might have been made illegal—language, religious customs, magical practices, medicinal
knowledge, even songs, stories, or dances—and they might be forced to carry them out in secret, or risk them being lost to history
forever. What heirlooms and documentation do they still have? Do they have religious texts and artefacts? Historical documents and
relics? It might be that everything has been destroyed or taken from them, leaving them to rely on oral heritage and the memories of
their elders.
Perhaps the slums of your world are occupied by people of many different demographics; different ethnic, religious, and cultural
backgrounds. Do they separate themselves, trying to keep their individual traditions alive? Or have they created a new, collective sub-
culture that borrows from many different traditions?
Your slums might act as a place of refuge and safety. The only place that marginalised people can feel free to be who they are. Unre-
stricted, unchecked, unchallenged. Although it might also become a refuge for wrongdoers and criminals, those who have, through
their own actions, marginalised themselves from society. It might make the slums unsafe, overseen by violent gangs constantly ﬁght-
ing over their territories. It might become a place where people simply swap one type of oppression for another.
One trope that often crops up in the fantasy genre is the romanticism of poverty. Poor people who are perfectly happy because their life
is simple, and that’s all they want. Pretty ideals of ‘living off the land’ and ‘make do and mend’. They have each other, what more could
they possibly need? I am not going to tell you how to write your characters, but just be mindful of the representations you're creating.
Iust make sure they tell the story you intend to tell.
Questions:
- Who is marginalised in your world?
- Why have they been marginalised?
- What has been taken from them?
- How are they keeping their history and culture alive?
- How are they living now?
- How do they plan to ﬁght back?



MAKING MONSTERS
When people are writing horror, I often hear them ask ‘how do I know that people will ﬁnd this scary?’ Of course, when you're writing
horror, you want your readers to feel fear, but everyone's afraid of different things. I'm terriﬁed of spiders and ﬂying, but that's not
scary to everyone. So, how do you know that your readers will be scared?
One common answer to this question is that, as long as it scares you, the writer, it will ﬁnd its audience of people who share that fear.
But that's not the right answer at all. It's not a case of throwing phobias at a wall and hoping that one sticks. The way you guarantee fear
in your reader, is by writing fear into your characters. If your characters are scared, your readers will be.
As writers, we are tasked with creating characters that are believable and relatable. Empathetic characters that our readers can see
themselves in. Characters our readers will care for, and fall in love with. So, if you've done your job right, and your readers empathise
with your characters, they will feel the same emotions along with them. So, if your characters are convincingly frightened, your read-
ers will be too.
When humans are born, they are born with just two innate fears: the fear of falling, and the fear of loud noises. All of our other fears
are learned. Either through ﬁrst-hand experience, or through the reactions of those around us. If you see lots of people running down a
road, screaming, you're likely to start running away too, even if you don't know what it is you're running from. Mass panic, and a herd
mentality. Someone might be scared of small spaces because they were once locked in a cupboard. Or because they watched a movie in
which they empathised with a character who was buried alive. Or because their parent is scared of small spaces, and they've adopted
the fear because we learn through imitation.
There is also an idea known as generational trauma, when the effects of a traumatic experience is passed to the following generations
through biological, environmental, psychological, or social means. Therefore, an event that happened several generations ago, can still
affect those born years later. They didn't experience it ﬁrst hand, but the effects of the trauma are still evident in them. This might be
through physical side-effects that are passed from parent to child. It might be through learned behaviour passed down through the
generations through stories. It might be cultural imprinting.
As writers, we know all about creating characters with tragic backstories. We love to give them years of trauma that they have over-
come to grow into the hero we need them to be. But, no one simply overcomes trauma and never thinks about it again. And that's where
,
we get our fears and anxieties. When you're creating your characters tragic pasts, pull those threads of trauma into their present-day
fears.
Were they locked in a dark cupboard as a punishment for bad behaviour? Did they watch their baby brother drown? Was their mother
killed by a wolf? That's where their fears lie. Those are the threads you need to tug at. Of course, everyone is going to be frightened of



a huge, terrifying monster running at them with claws and teeth bared. But that moment can be even more terrifying if the monster
represents one of their deep, life-long fears. Fears that really, really mean something to them. Fears that absolutely root them to the
spot, unable to react. Fears that you have foreshadowed and made mention of earlier in the story.
If the monster is the absolute worst thing they could possibly be made to face, especially if we've already seen them fail to face this
fear earlier in the story, then you can crank the tension, the conflict, and the fear up to the maximum level. You can have your readers,
literally, on the edges of their seats knowing that the fate of the whole story hangs on the main character being able to beat this ulti-
mate fear that they have consistently failed to beat their entire lives.
So, if you want your readers to feel the fear, show it in your character. Show it overwhelming them. Hang their success, their life, in
the balance. And the way to do that, is to tie that monster to them. To have it embody the fears they've carried for years. To embody
the one thing that scares them more than anything. The one thing that they are certain they will never be able to overcome. And make
the stakes as high as they can be. Enough to push your character onward. Enough to leave your character with no choice but to rise up
against the monster.
Likewise, you can tie your monster to your character's culture, using it in the same way as their personal fears. Culture deeply impacts
and imprints on us, whether we're aware of it or not. A ﬁshing town might have legends of sea creatures pulling down ﬁshing boats,
which plays into the natural anxieties over a loss of the income people rely on. It might have legends of sea creatures that drown lone
swimmers, stories that act as a warning about the dangers of the water and its lethal currents. A town in densely forested mountains
might have tales of trolls or giants that lead people deep into impossible mazes of caves and ravines. It might have tales of wolf or bear-
like creatures that reside in the depths of the trees. Perhaps your character's childhood friend disappeared into the woods, and their
body was never found. These cultural fears can wrap themselves around personal ones, knotting together, becoming a single thread for
you to pull at.
Of course, your monster might not be a snarling, hairy wolf»type thing at all. It might be an attractive man or a beautiful woman. It
might be someone your character knows and trusts. It might be an authority ﬁgure. It might even be a part of your character's own
persona; the secret side of them that they've been battling against all their life. It honestly doesn't matter whether your monster comes
in the form of a creature, a person, or your main character themselves, you can still create it in the exact same way.
Make your monster deeply impactful and important to your character's life, their history, and their culture. Make it mean everything
to them, embodying their deepest, darkest fears. This is how you make your monsters scary, regardless of their form. By making them
the thing your character is most afraid of, the thing most likely to make them fail.

DEPEATING THE MONSTER
In the horror genre, your characters are likely to kill the monster. At the very least, they will think they have killed it. In dark fantasy,
they’re likely to discover that the monster isn't the mindless, blood-lusting creature they thought it was. They might empathise with
it. They might even fall in love. And in grimdark, your characters may well discover, through their battles, that the monster actually
resides inside of them.
Just as your monster can take on any shape, its defeat can come in many different ways, too.
The monster’s defeat might be as blatant as its death. It might be forcing it back to its own territory; back to the remote mountains,
back to the depths of the sea, or the portal it crawled out of. Its defeat might be your character overcoming their fear of it. Maybe your
monster needs to be captured and locked inside a cave, or a tree, a magic circle, its own grave, or an inescapable dungeon.
But the defeat of the monster might be something altogether different. It might be toppling them from their position of power. It might
be revealing their true form, or their true intentions. It might be ﬁnding the humanity in them, or empathising with them, or under-
standing them in a way that reveals they're not a monster after all.
Defeating the monster might be a process of self reﬂection and realisation. If the monster resides inside the soul of your character, its
defeat might mean them admitting the truth about themselves. It might mean them opening their heart and allowing themselves to
be vulnerable, to be honest, or to let love into their life. Or, it might be accepting the monster inside them, and embracing the knowl-
edge that this is who they are, both the good and the bad.
Just as the defeat of the monster can be anything, it can also happen at any time in your story. The obvious place, of course, is at the
climax, just before the ﬁnal resolution and the ending of your story. But the defeat of the monster can be just as ﬁtting as the inciting
incident; the life-changing event that pushes your main character into action. The event that sets them off on their journey.
The monster’s defeat might reveal a truth about the world, or about their society, or about someone they love. By killing the monster
and revealing its lifeless remains, your character might prove the existence of monsters, or the appearance of monsters in your world.
It might be the ﬁrst proof that the monsters—previously thought to be unbeatable or immortal—can actually be killed.
It might be that the death of the monster leads to the death of nature, or a monarch, or civilisation, revealing that, somehow, their
life forces were inextricably linked. The monster’s death might cause an apocalyptic event; deadly storms, earthquakes, volcanoes. It
might release an airborne toxin, or bleed poison into the earth.
Perhaps when your main character killed the monster it revealed their hidden magical ability, or a strength they didn’t know they had.
Maybe they are rewarded for this act with prestige, power, wealth. Perhaps they are banished for what they have done.



And, of course, the defeat of the monster can be a conﬂict your character has to overcome along the way. It might act as a test, or a
pivot point in their journey, possibly changing their main goal or changing their strategy, or it might act as foreshadowing for a simi-
1a.r, larger ﬁght to come.
However your monster is defeated, and whenever it happens in the story, it should not be easy. In the previous chapter, we looked at
how to make your monsters scary by making them the embodiment of your character's greatest fear. And when that fear comes from
a past trauma, that's not something that's going to be easy to overcome.
Your character should emotionally and psychologically wrestle with the act, just as they might physically wrestle with the monster.
Perhaps the fury or vengeance they were fuelled with when they set out to ﬁnd the monster has burnt out, or maybe the monster they
ﬁnd is weak, injured, and pathetic to see. Maybe they are hit with a rush of sympathy. Perhaps the monster turns out to be a reﬂection
of themselves.
It might be that the biggest hurdles they have to overcome is their preparation for the ﬁght. Maybe they need to learn a highly complex
magical spell, or travel across the world to ﬁnd the only sword that will kill the monster. What might that journey cost them? What
might they have to sacriﬁce along the way?
And that's an important word; sacriﬁce. To make the defeat of the monster truly poignant and heart-wrenching, you can force your
character into making a choice. An almost impossible choice. Raise the stakes to a level that leaves them unable to decide until the last
minute. Hang everything on that moment. Have your readers as unsure as your character is about what they will decide to do, and how
much they are willing to sacriﬁce.
Will they kill the monster for the greater good? Even if it means destroying one village to save a city? Even if it means they can never
return home? Could they sacriﬁce the life of the person they love the most? Could they sacriﬁce themselves?
Or perhaps the sacriﬁce is giving up on glory, loyalty, money, freedom, in order to spare the monster’s life. Because, in the moment,
when they're eye-to-eye with the monster, they realise that this is not the monster of the story after all.

PARANORMAL ACTIVITY
When including elements of the paranormal in your world, you ﬁrst need to consider the main philosophies at play. Is your world
guided by scientiﬁc knowledge, with great respect held for the understanding of natural and physical laws? Perhaps your world is
shaped by religious philosophies, with religious leaders dominating the established narrative. Maybe spirituality and magic govems
your realm, with a wider scope for the things considered to be ordinary and commonplace.
Your world is likely to have a mix of various philosophies, with some dominating more than others. There might be clear cultural
differences between neighbouring kingdoms and countries of your world, as well as between the various areas and demographics
within each society. They might play nicely with each other, respectful and accepting of different points of view. They might not play
so nice, causing conflict, turmoil, or outright war.
Each philosophy will have a different approach to the paranormal. They might reject it entirely, always looking for scientiﬁc, medical,
or logical explanations. They might accept its existence, but view it as evil, malevolent, something that seeks to lead them astray. Or
they might embrace it as their way of life, everyday, celebrated, and an important part of their cultural heritage.
Remember that these views are likely to evolve and shift over time. As scientiﬁc and medical knowledge improves, what was once
thought of as paranormal might now have a diagnosis and a treatment plan. The advancement of technology might disprove old su-
perstitions, as the younger generations move away from the long-standing beliefs of their predecessors. Certain ideas about the world
will fall out of favour, replaced by new understandings. But don't always think about advancement in the same way as we understand
it in our culture. A return to more traditional values and philosophies might not be a backward step in your ﬁctional world.
By understanding the dominant philosophies in your world’s cultures, you can shape how an encounter with the paranormal might
impact your characters. Are they curious? Terriﬁed? Excited?
As a quick aside, I just want to mention the difference between the terms ‘paranormal’ and ‘supernatural’. While they are often used
interchangeably, they do have their own nuances and connotations. The term ‘supernatural’ is usually associated with divine or magi-
cal occurrences, often rooted in mythology or religious ideology. ‘Paranormal’ occurrences, on the other hand, tend to be thought of as
being more earth-bound, rooted in folklore and pseudoscience. You can use these terms however you want to use them in the world of
your story, but it's always handy to be aware of the pre-existing context by which your readers will understand them. just be sure to use
them in a way that conveys what you want them to convey. Of course, you don't need to use these terms at all, as people in your world
might have their own words for describing them.
Let's skip back to your character's understanding of the paranormal. The way that the paranormal is viewed in their culture will
impact the way they react to it which, in turn, informs the kind of paranormal elements you might want to include. Even if your



characters live in a magical society where the paranormal is, in fact, the normal, it doesn't mean you can‘t scare them. The word ‘para-
normal’ means something that is outside of the norm. Something unexpected. If magic is the norm in your character's life, then you
can still surprise them with something outside of that. Or with something they have been taught is evil; dark magic, necromancy, and
so on. Likewise, ghosts might be the norm, but poltergeists—ghosts able to touch and inﬂuence physical things—might not be.
In the same way that you can intensify the fearful impact of a monster, you can intensify a paranormal encounter. By tying it to your
character. By making it mean something to them.
A very common trope in horror is the haunted house. The reason it's such a popular and frequently used trope is because it is the
ultimate invasion of a safe space. Our homes are supposed to be our sanctuaries, the place where we can relax, sleep, and be at our most
vulnerable without worry. But, when that place is invaded, it is truly and wholly personal. It takes away a person’s refuge and sense of
peace. And our homes are even more than just sacred spaces. Culturally, the idea of home is almost synonymous with the idea of family.
So it is not merely a building being invaded by something unnatural, our families are invaded and put at risk. It's relatable and reso-
nant, and so, the trope endures.
This is one way you can catch your character off-guard. Even if they live in a world where the paranormal is commonplace. By placing
a paranormal occurrence somewhere unexpected, you can disarm them. Especially if it invades a place that is sacred to them, or one
that they are unable to leave.
Another reason paranormal entities can cause such fear is because they are outside of the realm of understanding. If your character
can't recognise and understand what they're seeing, how can they possibly know how to tackle it? How does one rid themselves of a
ghost? Or protect themselves from a psychic? Or hunt down a cryptid?
This is where, once again, we return to those philosophies present in your world. Can scientiﬁc theory provide a solution? Does the
religious canon hold any answers? Can we turn to folklore and superstitions for a solution? While one of your characters might be seek-
ing out a magic potion, another might be trying to hire an exorcist, and another might be seeking the opinions of several doctors.
Of course, your characters might be the ones who are considered to be paranormal. How do they navigate the world they live in? And
how do others react to them? Perhaps they exist in secret, hiding away from average humans. Maybe they are considered to be gods, or
to be demons. Maybe they are hunted down en masse, or bred in laboratories, or farmed. Maybe they enjoy a position at the top of the
food chain. What might happen if opinions about them suddenly change?

GOTHIC HORROR
The Gothic horror subgenre is one that places a focus on a foreboding atmosphere and rising tension. It's generally highly romanti-
cised, often historical (although you can, absolutely, write a contemporary Gothic horror), and tends to explore the inner turmoil of the
human soul at war with itself through the lens of a story that pitches the natural against the unnatural.
Filled with metaphors and heavy with thematic resonance, it's a subgenre that allows worldbuilders to explore the ways in which
setting can have a deep impact on character and story.
Atmosphere is such an integral part of Gothic horror, and is an area where you can bring your worldbuilding to the fore, creating ten-
sion with your setting, its climate and weather, and restrictions and barriers that prevent your characters from escaping their torment.
Abandoned or remote settings often feature in the genre, be it a country mansion, an abandoned castle, or the catacombs beneath an
empty cathedral. These settings act as a physical reﬂection of the theme of isolation, and often forces characters to face the dangers
alone, or with very little help and support. And that sense of isolation and helplessness is what allows the madness in.
There are often physical barriers that prevent the characters from leaving; a rising tide, deep fog setting in, or the approach of a fero-
cious storm. Sometimes, that barrier is psychological, with characters often remaining where they are out of a sense of duty, perhaps
with vulnerable people in their care, such as children or elderly relatives. By keeping your character in one place, you can use your set-
ting, your world, to push them to their absolute limits.
And the exploration of inner torment, of madness, of your character's ﬁght for their soul, all of this can be reﬂected in that setting. As
the paranormal element intensiﬁes, as they are pushed further from sanity, you can allow your setting to become increasingly menac-
ing and dangerous. Bring the storm closer, call wolves out of the surrounding forest, open a door that was previously locked.
Gothic horror is a fantastic playground for worldbuilders. It's a genre that turns the distinction between natural and unnatural on its
head, forcing your characters to question themselves, and to stop trusting any of their senses. It's a genre that truly pitches characters
against the world around them, turning the familiar unfamiliar, and transforming the benign into the menacing.
And all of the elements of Gothic horror can be blended into any other genre. You can have a gothic location in your epic fantasy, or
explore madness in your science-ﬁction, or trap your characters in an abandoned castle in your steampunk novel. In fact, if you write
a gothic steampunk, please let me know, because I deﬁnitely want to read that!



GHOSTS AND LIFE AFTER DEATH
Thinking back to the previous chapter on Paranormal Activity, the question of ghosts and the belief in life after death returns us to
the topic of the main philosophies that govern the cultures of your world. A culture guided by scientiﬁc knowledge may not believe in
life after death at all (unless someone has managed to prove its existence). A culture shaped by religious philosophies will, most likely,
believe in life after death, but may not believe in ghosts, or may consider them to be something evil. Something not to be spoken of. A
culture based on spirituality and magic, however, might view ghosts as constant companions, as guides and mentors.
These governing beliefs will also dictate whether or not a ghost is something to be feared. Do people in your world tell scary ghost
stories after dark, or do ghosts feature in stories as friendly helpers? Perhaps there are tales of mischievous ghosts, who seek to annoy
people or lead them astray. Maybe they are characters that demand offerings in return for blessings and good fortune. And woe betide
those who do not fulﬁl their requests.
Consider what life after death looks like in your cultures. Is it a place of peace and eternity, that exists far out of reach of earthly
realms? Maybe it is a space for people to right the wrongs they carried out in life. Perhaps it's more of a waiting room, before they are
reincarnated into another body. It might be a realm where they watch over their descendants, either able to intervene in their lives, or
left to look on helplessly.
The vision of life after death informs the purpose of ghosts. Perhaps ghosts are souls that have unﬁnished business, unable or unwill-
ing to move onto the afterlife until it is settled. Maybe ghosts are souls that have been rejected from whatever afterlife awaits, left to live
out eternity unseen and unheard. Or ghosts might be ancestors that can be called upon in times of need, they might be advisors, pro-
tectors, avengers. They might be spiritual leaders, or still governing society from beyond the grave.
Ghosts might stand as symbols. Perhaps seeing a ghost foretells of the death of a loved one. Maybe the appearance of a ghost before a
battle indicates which side will be victors. Ghosts might be known for leading lost wanderers back to the path, or for leading them off
it. They might play vital roles in rituals or spells.
If ghosts appear for ominous or sinister purposes, they will be feared and unwanted. If they appear for helpful or reassuring reasons,
they will be eagerly awaited and welcomed when they come.
And just as their (perceived) purpose affects how they are received, it also affects how they are dealt with. Maybe there are blessings or
offerings thought to keep them at bay. Herbs hung above the door, candles burning in windows, dead lambs left at the gate. Perhaps
they are welcomed in by special songs sung in the darkness of a new moon. Maybe they are attracted in by back doors left open, ribbons
tied in trees, or runes carved into door frames.



There may be people called upon who can rid someone of an unwanted ghost; priests or spiritual leaders, mages or witches, scientists
or doctors. Likewise, there may be people who can be hired to bring ghosts near, those with a unique and special ability to commune
with the dead. But we'll discuss that in just a moment.
Questions:
- What are the main beliefs regarding life after death?
- What are ghosts? Why and how are they among the living?
- How are ghosts generally received?
- What does their appearance signify?
- How are they dealt with?



COMMUNICATING WITH SPIRITS
Whether it's spirit boards, mediums, magic circles, or just a chat on a park bench, there are all kinds of different ways that people could
communicate with spirits.
With the work you've done in the previous couple of chapters, you should have a good idea of how the living react to the spirits of the
dead, and whether or not they'd be up for a quick chat with them.
Consider the purpose ghosts have in your world; whether they are harbingers of sinister events or helpful mentors and conﬁdantes.
This will tell you the kind of communication that might happen between the living and the dead, be it an exorcism or a summoning.
This might be something that anyone can do. Maybe your spirits are ever-present, ever-listening, and people just need to speak to them.
Perhaps they can simply have a chat like they're speaking to another living person. Maybe the connection is enhanced if they meditate,
or burn particular incense, or travel to a place that holds signiﬁcance for the spirit they wish to contact.
Or it might be more difﬁcult than that. They might need to enter a trance state, or perform bloodletting, or travel to a particular stone
circle to perform a complex rite under a waxing moon. The more difﬁcult it becomes and the more barriers there are between the living
and the dead, the less regularly it is likely to happen. And, when we're writing a story, we like barriers and restrictions, because that's
where conﬂict can come into play. Your character might desperately need advice or information from a long-dead ancestor, but if they
have to wait for the next harvest moon, or summer solstice, they're going to have to work hard to reach their goal.
Of course, communicating with the dead might require speciﬁc skills, talents, knowledge, or expertise not possessed by everyone. Your
characters might have to call on a priest, a mage, a medium, or a shaman to speak to the spirits for them. Even then, it isn't necessarily
going to be easy. It might require years of study and practice, or it might not be something that can be taught at all. It might be an in-
nate ability that someone is simply born with.
Perhaps mediumship abilities are dying out in your world, pushing the prices of mediums’ services past the point of affordability for
most people. As society changes over time, people might stop believing in such things, meaning mediums are ﬁghting for the last
remaining jobs, or have to close their businesses completely. Maybe there is a political or religious shift, and the practice becomes out-
lawed, leaving mediums working in secret, ever scared of being found out.
If ghosts are unwanted entities, who might it fall on to cleanse them from the world? Religious leaders? Scientists? Maybe it's such
a physically taxing job that exorcists are more like athletes or warriors. If an ability to communicate with spirits is an innate ability
only found in a few people, exorcists might ﬁnd themselves unwillingly forced into the profession. It might be violent, traumatising,
exhausting. Maybe there are people who believe exorcism to be inhumane, and protest against the practice, claiming that spirits have



as much right to exist as the living do. Your character may well be an exorcist themselves, one who sympathises with the spirits, mak-
ing their day job a daily wrestle with their own conscience.
Questions:
- Who has the ability to communicate with spirits?
- How do the living and the dead communicate?
- What barriers stand in the way of communication?
- What is the purpose of communication?



SPIRIT WORLDS
Spirit worlds are a concept that exist in cultures throughout the whole of our world's history, in one form or another. They might be a
place that people anticipate going to after their death. Or they might be somewhere closer, more immediate, with ways and means for
moving between the world of the living, and that of the dead.
Building on the work you've already done around your world's beliefs regarding life after death, and communication with spirits, you'll
probably already have a good idea of whether there is a way to access spirit worlds. Whether it's possible for the spirits to cross back, or
for the living to visit. Of co11rse, you may have more than one spirit world, and some might be more accessible than others.
As with any magic system you create, you want to place restrictions or consequences on any crossover with the spirit world. Restric-
tions and consequences create barriers, which means conflict; the very lifeblood of any story. If your character needs to enter the spirit
world to achieve their goal, make it hard for them. Force them to debate whether it's worth the struggle. Don't make it as simple as pop-
ping next door for coffee.
Let's look at some possible restrictions ﬁrst. Maybe the way between the two worlds is only open at certain times. Maybe on a full moon,
or a solstice, or once every 800 years. Maybe only children can pass through, or people with true intentions, or people who have expe-
rienced profound loss.
It might be that the means of travel is diﬁicult. Perhaps the entrance to the spirit world is difﬁcult to ﬁnd, or diﬂicult to get to, or almost
impossible to open. Maybe only highly trained shamans can cross over. They might need to enter a dangerous trance state. One that
they can only enter if they are near to death themselves. They might have to bleed, or ingest poison, or slow their heartbeat.
Those wishing to cross into the spirit world might have to pass a test or trial. Perhaps it is mentally challenging or physically exhaust-
ing. Maybe they need to wear armour made of an extremely rare metal, or recite a spell that has been long-forgotten, or carry a magical
amulet that has been lost for centuries.
By placing restrictions on the spirit world's access, you force your characters to work hard to gain entry, testing their determination,
their desperation, courage, and fortitude.
Rather than restrictions to entry, your spirit world might come with consequences. Of course, you might want to be truly brutal to
your characters, facing them with both restrictions and consequences. I won't judge you for it.
Perhaps your characters need to sacriﬁce something to enter the spirit world, or in order to come back to the world of the living. Their
soul, their happiness, their magical abilities. Maybe travelling in the spirit world is physically painful, requiring treatment or rest after
returning. Perhaps the chances of returning at all are terrifyingly slim. Your characters might be irrevocably changed by their visit to



the spirit world, leaving them a shell of their former self, or plagued by haunting voices, or unable to reconnect with reality. Maybe the
spirit world is a place of such love and light that they yea_rn and ache to return to it, leaving them jaded and disinterested in life.
By creating consequences to entering the spirit world, you force your characters into a moral dilemma, having to weigh up the beneﬁts
and the importance of their goal against the consequences. You force them to decide what matters to them most, and what they are
willing to sacriﬁce in order to get it.
By putting your characters through these trials, you can truly explore who they are as a person, and what lies deep inside them. Are
they really the shrewd and determined person they claim to be? Are they honestly as brave and resolute as they think they are? Maybe
they ﬁnd out that they are more of a hero than they ever imagined, surprising everyone around them, and even themselves. Perhaps
they are shocked to discover the things they truly value, and the things they are willing to sacriﬁce. And that journey of discovery isn't
just for your characters, because your readers get to come along for the ride too. And that's exactly what keeps them turning the pages.
What does your spirit world look like? Is it very different to your living world, or quite similar? Consider the theme and mood of your
living world. Do you want the spirit world to match and strengthen it, or do you want to present it as a stark contrast to highlight the
difference? And think about the purpose of your spirit world in your story and your character’s journey. Do you want it to serve as a rest
from the trials they have been facing already, perhaps even as a comedic break from a tense atmosphere? Or do you want them to face
hardships and unease while they travel the spirit world?
You can make your spirit world look however you want it to, or you can shroud it in mist and fog, keeping its secrets safe. Of course,
your story might not follow the characters who enter it at all. Your readers might need to wait for them to return for any insight into
what the spirit world is like. Perhaps your characters lose their memories of it once they emerge, keeping the secrets of the spirits safe
from the living.

THE LIVING DEAD
Whether a zombie apocalypse befalls your society, whether necromancers conjure in the shadows, or whether vampires walk amongst
humans, there are many ways that the living dead might play a part in your world.
Death is, by its very nature, much feared in many cultures. A deep~rooted survival instinct of repulsion in the face of death kept our
ancestors safe from disease and infection. And that repulsion lives on in our own DNA. A fear of something that seems almost human,
but isn't, and shouldn't be.
The living dead, in whatever form, force us to face things that we, culturally, do our best to ignore. First, it forces us to face our own
mortality. Second, it forces us to face our base instincts; to accept that, when it comes down to it, we're nothing more than animals.
Many representations of the living dead act on base survival instincts; eat, kill, survive. Without compassion, without humanity.
The living dead also represent another fear; the fear of those we should be able to trust becoming someone we cannot. Of friend
becoming foe. Of family becoming something we might be forced to kill, before they kill us. The living dead force us to see things anew
—to see ourselves anew—and we probably won't like it. And the living dead take the position humans have enjoyed for so long. The top
of the food chain.
Of course, the living dead in your world might not be merciless creatures acting on their base instincts. They might be cultured,
reﬁned, intelligent, even kind. They might live among humans as their equals, their betters, or their subordinates. They might govem
over humans, they might serve humans, they might live in the shadows entirely unknown to humans.
Perhaps they have established civilised societies and subcultures of their own. Maybe their culture sits happily alongside or integrated
with human culture. Maybe it opposes and challenges human culture.
What role do you need the living dead to have in your story? Are they feared? A plague to be overcome? Perhaps their role is as
mysterious love interests. Maybe they exist to reveal a truth about the nature of humans, or to highlight the fragility of mortality. You
might wish them to reﬂect themes of rot, depravity, greed, or social division. They might be there to become the sympathetic charac-
ters, while the monstrous nature of humankind is highlighted.
Their role in your story, the job you want them to do, will determine what they look like, how they act, and how people react to them.
It will determine their place in society, and how much power they have to change it, or to upend it entirely.

MADNESS
Madness (or perceived madness) is a common theme found in horror and grimdark ﬁction. While horror forces characters to the brink
of terror, often resulting in madness, grimdark pushes characters to see the darkness inside themselves, and the madness that resides
there.
When characters are suffering paranormal hauntings, uncovering unknown monsters, or discovering dark secrets, these revelations
are often perceived as insanity by others. In their moments of terror, when they desperately reach out for help, your characters might
not be believed. Their suffering might be dismissed as fantasy, as hallucination, malicious lying or, indeed, madness. Or they may be
purposefully discredited by someone who seeks to keep the truth hidden, someone who beneﬁts from secrets remaining secret.
An accusation of madness, and the reactions of doubt, condescension, and disregard that it elicits from others, increases a feeling of
helplessness, and hopelessness, for your character. They reach out for support in a traumatic situation, and receive none. This leaves
them with no choice but to tackle the situation entirely by themselves. To face the monster alone. This is their moment when all hope
seems lost. Their crisis point. Their darkness before the dawn. And this is where we get to see what they're really made of.
In horror, your character is likely to prove the existence of the monster to others, and to restore their reputation as a sane person. But
in the grimdark genre, the ending isn't usually so bright. Your character might discover, through introspection, that they were always
mad. Or that the madness has become an important, vital part of who they are. They might have succeeded because of the madness
within them. In contrast, they might discover that it is not them who is mad, but society at large. And if there is hope to be found, it is
in the fact that, having faced and realised the truth, they can ﬁnally accept and embrace it.

- How does madness feature in your story?



NOT SO INNOCENT
The horror genre is all about subverting things. Taking what you know, and turning it into something unfamiliar and strange. Making
safe places feel unsafe. Making the harmless seem dangerous. Making the innocent not so.
I talked about the haunted house trope before, explaining why it is so much more than the mere haunting of a physical space. It's that
subversion of a space where you feel perfectly at ease, a space that is exclusively yours, being invaded and becoming a place that feels
incredibly unsafe. We also see this in stories of home invasions.
I'm sure that most of us have felt an unease while moving around our own homes at night. A place that feels entirely familiar in
daylight, is suddenly a place with a potential for danger. The curtain that looks like a person, the pile of clothes that could be someone
crouching, even our own reﬂections caught in a dark mirror. Things that, should we ﬂick on a light, instantly return to their harmless
forms.
We see this subversion in several horror tropes: always needing to watch the quiet ones, or the killer coming from within the ranks
of the main cast, and possibly the ultimate example; creepy children. Be they ghosts, zombies, killers, or cannibals, there's no better
example of subversion of the innocent to the dangerous. It's biological hard-wiring that we view children as harmless and innocent.
That we view them as people we need to protect. Subvert that, and what is there left in the world that we can possibly trust?
But it’s not just the horror genre that plays with our expectations like this. In dark fantasy, we might have a loving boyfriend that turns
out to be a vampire. Or a familiar, real-world city that has a hidden, dark, paranormal world beneath it. And in the grimdark genre, your
character may well discover that they, themselves, are the object of subversion. They may discover a darkness inside themselves they
had been unaware of, or ﬁnd that they never really knew themselves at all.
Questions:
- How does the subversion of the innocent feature in your story?



THE OTHERS ARE BAD
Antagonists and villains come in all forms; from the school bully or the corrupt politician to the psychopath or the evil overlord. And
they don't need to be a single character, either. The antagonist can come in the form of an oppressive, corrupt government, an evil cult,
or even an entire nation of people.
Fear or mistrust of ‘the other’, of those who are different, can highlight prejudice in a single character, or create a culture of division in
a society, or pitch entire kingdoms against one another.
The perceived other might be a certain demographic of society; rich against poor, men against women, mortals against immortals.
There might be divisions between different species or the populations of neighbouring countries. The dislike might be explained
historically, culturally, politically. They may have been ancient enemies, even if their political relations have improved. It might be an
argument over land and borders, or over vital, valuable, or dwindling resources. Perhaps one country refused to take in refugees when
help was needed. Maybe religious differences have created cultures that oppose each other's values and morals.
There are many different reasons that divisions appear between different demographics of people, and just as many different ways
that it is evident. It might be no more than people bickering in their villages, or clusters of populations in cities. The division might be
instilled in society's institutions; separate schools, unequal opportunities, disparity of wealth and freedoms. The separation might be
written into law, with mixed marriages outlawed, or certain people barred from using magic, from practising their religion, or from
existing at all.
In dark fantasy, a character might be forced to question their culturally embedded prejudices when they need to seek refuge with the
other, or have their life saved by the other, or even fall in love with the other. After adjusting their own attitudes, they might seek to
change the opinions of society, to challenge the law, to reorder their world entirely.
In grimdark, a character might be the other themselves, living under oppression and seclusion. Perhaps they form an underground
resistance, seek help from ancient, troublesome gods, or discover a source of power lost for centuries. As they battle to change their life
for the better, they will be faced with the question of just how far they will go to address the inequality. And whether their ﬁght for
recognition becomes a desire for vengeance. And whether the battle is truly against the establishment, or whether it’s actually against
the monster inside themselves.
A dislike of the other can be used to highlight themes of division, inequality, or of a crumbling society. Or it can be used to reﬂect the
division inside a single character, and the eternal struggle between the two sides of their personality.
Questions:



Where does a dislike of the other exist in your world?
How is this evident in society?
How does it impact your character?
What role does it play in their journey?
How does it change throughout the story?



NATURE IS BAD
When we think about fantasy worldbuilding, we often think about those beautiful, sweeping epic fantasy landscapes. Stunning
scenery with mountains, and mysterious forests, and cascading waterfalls. But amongst that, there are also marshes and bogs, jagged
rocks, ice ﬁelds, or scorching deserts.
These difﬁcult, dangerous terrains can be barriers that stand between your characters and their goal. They can test your characters,
testing their determination to continue, as well as their physical ability to cross the landscape. They can cause your characters to re-
think their plan, forcing them on long, onerous detours, or making them risk their lives with a treacherous shortcut.
Or your whole world might be a harsh landscape where humans ﬁght, every day, to survive. It might have always been this way, or it
might have become this way, either through a sudden apocalyptic event, or something that evolved more slowly over time. It might be
the natural evolution of your world, or it might have been something humans brought upon themselves.
Beyond all of the challenging landscapes you can force your characters to cross, you can also introduce poisonous plants, carnivorous
plants, even plants that uproot themselves to attack. You can have deadly plants that look almost identical to medicinal ones, with only
the most experienced herbologists able to tell the difference. But even they might make mistakes.
Nature might be fully sentient, and form an army. It might take revenge on humans. It might decide that humanity's time is over, and
it's time for nature to reign. Perhaps your characters have to battle thorny brambles that wrap around them, squeezing and tightening.
They might have to avoid poisonous spore clouds carried on the wind. Seed bombs might shoot out projectiles that bury in the skin,
taking root immediately. The army of ﬂora might form thick, impenetrable walls, fortifying their territory with living battlements.
Nature might take on humanoid forms; wood spirits and dryads, water nymphs, characters that step out of the rock, that are formed
in molten lava. There might be air spirits, forming bodies out of clouds, or even those who can embody darkness or light. Perhaps these
creatures live among humans in their natural forms, accepted as another species in the world. Or maybe they can transform, fully, into
human form, indistinguishable but for small differences such as glowing eyes, hair that constantly moves and ﬂows, or webbed ﬁngers
and toes. Maybe they can live among humans mostly undetected, while they await their chance to take back the world.
When you make nature the antagonist, it gives you an opportunity to attack your characters from every angle. You can interrupt their
journey with a labyrinthine mountain range. Or you can take them to the brink of death with a poisonous berry. Alternatively, you can
bring nature to their door, and into their homes, whether it's in disguise or not. Or you can turn the whole planet against them, with a
habitat that is simply not designed for humans to survive in. You can starve humans, turn them into prey, or batter them with the full
force of nature.



And remember, in you_r world, everything is connected, and everything impacts everything else. The challenges that exist in nature
will impact the culture and the way society views nature. Perhaps the difﬁcult landscapes are empty of human civilisation, or maybe
there are small villages, where people have perfectly adapted to thrive there, creating unique subcultures of their own. In a world
where it is hard to survive, people might view nature as an enemy, or as something that needs to be tamed and controlled. Alterna-
tively, they might revere and respect it, ever aware of its power.
And if plants are sentient, living as part of society, this will have a huge impact on the culture. Are they accepted and treated as equals,
or are they shunned, and forced to live at the fringes of human society? Perhaps it is humans that live in second place. How does the
existence of sentient plant-beings affect people's attitudes to the rest of nature? How do they navigate felling trees, picking ﬂowers, or
eating vegetables?
Questions:
- What challenging landscapes are there in your world?
- What dangerous plants exist?
- How else does nature challenge your characters?
- How does it interrupt their progress to their goal?



RELIGION IS BAD
Another common trope in both horror and grimdark, is religion being bad. Whether in the form of a fanatical parent, a dangerous
cult leader, or an oppressive government characterised by religious extremism, these narratives explore the dark side of faith and its
capacity to justify horriﬁc actions. It highlights the potential for religious beliefs to be manipulated and exploited by characters seek-
ing to inflict harm.
It is also, once again, a form of subversion; taking something that is supposed to be peaceful and of great comfort to people, and turning
it into something dangerous, corrupt, and malevolent.
There are numerous ways in which you can create a religion for your world that acts as an antagonist. Perhaps the tenets and beliefs of
the religion itself are violent and immoral; ritual sacriﬁce, demonisation of outsiders, teachings of superiority and divine right, doom
prophecies, justiﬁcation of killing non-believers. The very foundation the belief stands on can be corrupt and rooted in hatred, offering
up a whole range of opportunities for conﬂict and villainy. Perhaps your character is captured by zealots, to be offered up as a sacriﬁce.
Maybe your character seeks to rescue a loved one who has been indoctrinated into the religion. Your character might seek to reveal the
corrupt practices, to make the truth of their teachings public.
Alternatively, it might be an issue of power. Maybe a cult is led by a power-hungry leader who controls and manipulates their followers.
Perhaps certain religious leaders abuse their position, using their privilege to pursue their own ambitions. Even if the teachings of a
religion promote harmony, peace, and acceptance, it doesn't mean that everyone follows that. You might have factions that are led
by leaders who want to push a different agenda, cherry-picking from their sacred texts, and twisting the meanings to ﬁt their own
prejudices. And by creating their own narrative, they create a ﬂock of people who think like them, and act like them, under the guise of
religious doctrine.
Another option is to create symbols or artefacts for a religion that are ominous and menacing, full of hidden and double meanings. A
religion might adopt a particular symbol that has historically been used to oppress a particular demographic of people. It might be a
symbol that, at ﬁrst glance, seems harmless, but incorporates words from ancient languages. Words that speak of violence and hatred.
You might choose to give these symbols true, real power; such as magic circles or powerful runes. Maybe your religious leaders wear
habits adorned with runes that, separately, are quite harmless, but when they come together, create a powerful magic circle. One that
opens a portal to the past, or to another dimension altogether. You can also incorporate artefacts into your religion that are represen-
tative of violence and anger. Maybe the followers worship an ancient bloodied spear, or ropes once used as nooses. Perhaps they have
artefacts that are cursed, or charged with malevolent magical properties.
Also consider the inﬂuence your evil religion holds. If it's a small cu.lt, with just a handful of followers, their inﬂuence might be
relatively small. They might be dismissed and ridiculed, and not thought about beyond that. Of course, appearances can always be



deceptivei Even a small cult can have friends in high places. Perhaps one of the king's advisors or a military leader is a devout follower,
using their position to further the agenda of the cult and to cover up their illegal actions. Maybe a cult has followers in a number of
important and inﬂuential roles. Suddenly, the strange people living an alternative lifestyle on the edge of a small town, take on a much
more sinister role in society.
Far from being covert and secretive, your country might be directly governed by religious leaders, with the heads of the faith and the
heads of the state being one and the same. The king might have a political advisor in one ear, and a religious advisor in the other. The
laws of the land might be governed by religion, with punishments taken directly from their sacred texts. The religious teachings might
be overbearing and unfair, targeting particular groups of society with fewer freedoms, fewer rights, or even no right to exist at all.
Questions:
- What is bad about your world's religion?
- How is this malevolence evident?
- What impact and inﬂuence does religion have in society?
- How does it impact your characters?



GODS ARE BAD
More dangerous than religious zealots preaching malice, are the gods themselves. Omnipotent, immortal, untouchable beings. Just
imagine if this ultimate, unstoppable power were to come from a place of diabolical spite and hostility. How could your characters es-
cape that? How could they overcome it?
By introducing this kind of invincible, supreme evil into your world, and letting it rule over every living thing, it might seem like you're
giving your characters an impossible task. That their quest against the gods is doomed from the outset. But isn't that what we love
about stories? Seeing characters conquer a problem that seems unconquerable?
Gods intent on doing bad is an idea that ﬁts perfectly into all of our genres here; horror, dark fantasy, and grimdark. So, no matter what
you're writing, you can pitch your David against this Goliath. But it might not be a stone in David's sling this time.
There might be an ancient prophecy, long-forgotten, that hints at a weakness in the gods’ strength. There might be a curse or a clause,
created long before the gods existed, that curtails their power or their capacity to do harm. Perhaps there is an ancient relic; the one and
only item that is capable of killing a god. There might be a paradox or contradiction in the gods’ existence, allowing a clever hero to turn
their own power against them. For example, a god who controls both creation and destruction could be tricked into a situation where
they must create and destroy simultaneously, causing a self-destructive loop or overwhelming their power. Or a god who governs both
truth and deception could be presented with a scenario where truth and lies are indistinguishable, confusing and weakening them.
Maybe your characters have the opportunity to form alliances with allies that have the combined strength to take on a god. Perhaps
they partner with powerful mythical beings who have their own grudges against the gods, such as dragons, titans, or elemental spirits.
Maybe there are some lesser gods or demigods who oppose the cruelty of the ruling gods. Fonning an alliance with these rebel deities
might provide crucial support and insider knowledge.
Characters might learn and master forbidden forms of magic that are powerful enough to challenge the gods, although it might come
at a great personal cost. Maybe they learn of alchemical potions that can temporarily imbue them with divine powers or protect them
from the gods‘ wrath.
Maybe your characters can ﬁnd a way to rally all mortals to a uniﬁed uprising. The collective will and determination of humanity
might manifest as a force strong enough to challenge the gods. Perhaps this ﬁght ends when a powerful, true hero presents themselves
as a willing sacriﬁce, creating a rift in the divine realm and weakening the gods’ hold on the mortal world.
There might be a way to sow discord and mistrust among the gods, exploiting their egos and rivalries to turn them against one another.
Or your characters might challenge the gods to ancient, binding trials or competitions, invoking cosmic laws that even the gods must
obey. By winning these trials, your characters can strip the gods of their powers or banish them forever.



There might be a higher realm where the gods‘ powers are diminished or nulliﬁed. Where the gods can be confronted and defeated.
Your characters might ﬁnd a way to open a portal to it and summon primordial forces or beings that pre~date the gods. These entities
might have the power to unmake the gods that they, themselves, created aeons ago.
So, you see, even when the enemy seems unbeatable, when all hope is lost, there is actually more than one way to kill a god.
Questions:
- How are your gods being bad?
- What can be used to defeat them?
- How do your characters discover this method for vanquishing gods?
- What must they do or sacriﬁce in order to succeed?



MAGIC IS BAD
The concept of good magic and bad magic, black and white magic, is a very familiar one. But maybe all magic is bad.
When creating a magic system, it's important to give it either restrictions, or consequences, or both. If a character can use magic for
anything they ever want, without any repercussions, there is nothing to stop them from reaching their ultimate goal on page one.
Without conﬂict, without barriers standing between them and their goal, you have no story.
One way to make magic bad (and to open up those opportunities for conﬂict) is through the consequences of using magic. These
consequences might be physical, such as use of magic causing the user to age, to lose memories, to become violently ill, or to descend,
gradually, into madness.
Otherwise, these consequences might be cultural. Such as the use of magic incurring harsh punishments such as ﬁnes, imprisonment,
corporal punishment, or even capital punishment. Rather than legal repercussions, the consequences might be social, such as public
shaming, banishment, or exclusion from an institution or the loss of a fellowship membership. Remember; sometimes death is not the
worst thing that you can do to a character.
If you decide that the consequences of using magic are going to be cultural, rather than physical (of course, they can always be both),
then you need to consider why these consequences exist. Which leads us neatly on to other ways in which you can make magic bad.
If magic is outlawed, or disapproved of, there are reasons for this. Of course, one of them might be political. It might simply be a means
of controlling magic users. Maybe the government doesn't want magic users to be free to use their powers as they wish. Perhaps they
have been feeding the population lies and propaganda for generations, meaning that the mistrust of magic and the demonisation of
magic users becomes ingrained in the culture of your world. Or, maybe, the rich and the powerful wish to keep magic all to themselves,
perpetuating the idea that it is bad while they, secretly, engage in it themselves. Using magic to increase their own wealth and status
while preventing others from accessing or using it.
Alternatively, the reason for making magic use illegal might truly be for the protection of the public. Magic might be unwieldy, with
unpredictable results. Perhaps much magic knowledge has been lost, leaving behind incomplete scraps of spells and incantations that
produce outcomes different to those expected or intended.
Maybe its use is restricted, and only scholars who spend decades studying magic are allowed to use it. Or people who are physically
strong. Or those who have passed rigorous psychological assessments.
It might be that magic is sentient. It might have its own goals and agendas, constantly ﬁghting against the will of magic users. It might
be mischievous and sly, playing tricks on those who aren't careful or respectful enough. Maybe magic draws power from magic users,



draining their energy and shortening their life. It might be harnessing power until it is strong enough to attack the population, eradi-
cating them all.
Magic might be drawn from a dangerous source. Perhaps magic users have to open up tears between worlds to access the power, tears
that sometimes let other things slip through. Magic might be sourced directly from other beings, beings that have their own goals and
agendas, beings that are often malevolent or ﬁckle.
Or, the source of magical power might be entirely unknown. Some might believe it is a divine gift bestowed upon certain people from
the gods, a reward for devotion and obedience. Others might believe that it is an evil temptation, sent to trick people, distract them, or
lead them astray. But while the source of magic is unknown and, therefore, the consequences are unknown, society might decide that
it is best not to use it. just in case.

FAIRYTALE RETELLINGS
Fairytale retellings within the dark fantasy genre have enjoyed a signiﬁcant rise in popularity in recent years. By incorporating darker
and more mature themes and storylines into these classic tales, they can appeal to a broader audience, particularly among adult read-
ers. Proving that fairytales are, most deﬁnitely, not just for children.
As stories originally designed to teach moral lessons, fairytales often contain strong central themes such as sacriﬁce, love, betrayal,
or redemption. They also offer clear distinctions between good and evil. These are all themes and concepts that sit very comfortably
within the mood and tone of the dark fantasy genre.
Over the years, fairytales have been softened, sanitised, and transformed into charming tales of ‘happily ever after‘. Originally, these
stories were dark, cautionary tales reﬂecting the harsh realities and dangers of everyday life. They carried themes of violence, revenge,
and supernatural retribution. The narratives often featured grisly outcomes and severe punishments for the wicked, which contrast
greatly with the lighter, more optimistic versions that dominate contemporary popular culture. In order to write a dark fantasy
retelling, the original stories carry all the macabre shadows and eerie elements you need.
Of course, you will probably be looking for your own twist, your own perspective. You might wish to deepen and darken the story's
central conﬂict, to exaggerate the antagonist, to torture the hero even further. You may look to add heartbreak, a trial, supernatural
elements, and to do away with any happy ending. Weaving a fairytale into the dark fantasy genre involves adding complexity into the
plot and characters, introducing higher stakes, and crafting a more foreboding or mysterious atmosphere and setting.
Many dark fantasy retellings borrow heavily from the gothic horror genre; incorporating elements such as bleak settings, morally
ambiguous characters, and themes of fear and despair, all of which contribute to a creeping sense of dread and suspense. Gothic liter-
ature's inﬂuence on dark fantasy is signiﬁcant, particularly in its exploration of the psychological aspects of fear alongside the use of
supernatural elements. Dark fantasy is a genre that combines the allure of fantasy with the chilling aspects of horror.
Make use of settings that are inherently ominous or unsettling, such as haunted forests, crumbling castles, or dystopian kingdoms.
You can use weather and darkness to increase the tense and threatening atmosphere. But, most importantly, you need to make sure
it impacts your character. Darkness that increases their sense of paranoia, a wind that seems to call their name, a thickening fog that
forces them into isolation, a dampness that leaves mould patches on the walls. Mould patches that look more and more like skeletal
hands. Hands that seem to move all by themselves.
Make sure that your worldbuilding takes on an active role in your story. I'll say it over and over; treat your worldbuilding like you treat
a character. Give it goals and motivations. Give it an active part. Let it impact on your characters, whether it seeks to help them, or to



hinder them. And this is never more important than in stories that rely so heavily on setting and atmosphere: horror, dark fantasy, and
grimdark.
It's not enough to simply create a dark world and then let the story unfold within it. The world needs to grow with the story. It needs to
fester, and decay, and sour. As the tension rises in the story, the shadows in the world need to lengthen, the sky needs to darken. Once
your characters reach the point where it seems all hope it lost, your world should be so dark, so imposing, that it feels like the sun might
never rise over it again.
The tropes and themes you choose can all be reﬂected in your worldbuilding, amplifying their resonance and underscoring their
signiﬁcance throughout the story. For example, you can use the Cursed Protagonist trope for your world; putting your world under the
inﬂuence of a dark spell cast by a powerful magic user. This curse may have put your world into perpetual darkness, or put all other
magic into a slumber, or corrupted the souls of its people.
If your chosen theme is the corruption of power, you can reﬂect this in your world. As those in power become more twisted by it, you
might mirror this with widespread famine and disease. If your theme is isolation and alienation, you might use storms to separate
and isolate your characters. You might use climate change to rearrange the layout of your world, with countries suddenly split in two
by rising waters. Sacriﬁce and redemption themes might be highlighted by a world that sees a devastating death of the natural world,
with new vegetation growth appearing only once your hero has made their greatest sacriﬁce.
Dark fantasy and fairytales are both perfect places for creating a hidden world. It might be a separate world, accessed by some kind
of magical portal or a tear in the fabric of reality. Or, it might be a world within the world; just a separate society kept hidden from
humans. What happens when these two worlds meet each other? What happens if the door between them is opened, and left open?
What might slip through?
An open doorway allows the mingling of the magical and the mundane, but also the inﬁltration of malevolent forces into the unsus-
pecting everyday world. The consequences can be both wondrous and catastrophic. As entities and energies from the hidden realm
spill over and the boundaries of both worlds crumble, you are offered a wealth of possibilities for conﬂict, for confusion, and for cor-
ruption. This duality of worlds can be used to reﬂect the dual, conflicting themes so often found in this genre: madness versus sanity,
control versus chaos, humanity versus monstrosity, and life versus death. It illuminates that clear distinction between good and evil
that is so quintessential to fairytales.
Your world can even take on an anti-hero role, making morally ambiguous decisions. Perhaps nature chooses to kill a huge number of
people in order to save the future of the planet. Maybe it has to make the air poisonous to eradicate an invading species hell-bent on
destruction, regardless of the innocent souls it also kills. It might be that your world's magic system is being abused, being used for per-
sonal greed and cruelty. Maybe magic itself decides to ﬁght back, cursing those who misuse it, or destroying itself altogether.



Retelling fairytales in the dark fantasy genre offers a multitude of ways to explore and expand upon the original stories; darkening the
narrative, modernizing the elements, redeﬁning the characters, and intricately building a world that complements and emphasises the
themes and atmosphere. The key to a successful retelling is not just about what you change, but in how you blend old elements with
new to create a story that feels both familiar and fresh.
Questions:
- Which fairytales might you retell?
- What tropes will you include?
- What themes will you explore?
- How can your world reﬂect these themes and tropes?



DARKNESS AND SHADOWS
Are people really afraid of the darkness, itself? Or are they afraid of what might linger there?
Darkness and shadows are more than mere backdrops in the realms of horror, dark fantasy, and grimdark. They shape and mould the
universe these stories inhabit, twisting things that were once familiar into something unsettling and unknown. The darkness hides
the truth and conceals dangers, and shadows move, and grow, and breathe with a life-force of their own. And, once again, in these
genres where setting plays such an important part, the darkness and shadows of the world mirror the darkness and shadows in the
hearts, souls, and minds of your characters.
Be it fog-laden forests, desolate moorlands, or craggy mountains under moonlit skies, your settings can instantly evoke a sense of
dread. The small details that pull at all of the senses—a chill wind, the rustle of dry leaves, the distant howl of an unseen creature, the
stench of rot and decay—help to draw your reader deep into your fearful landscape, amplifying its atmosphere of foreboding.
You can also have creatures, monsters, and beings that are made of darkness. Entities that wait in the shadows, completely unseen,
their movements dismissed as a trick of the light. Formless creatures, ﬂuid creatures, with no distinct form. Creatures that ﬂow like
water, moving through the darkness, becoming a part of it. Monsters that can envelop, possess, and smother. Monsters that can whis-
per into someone’s ear and creep into their mind, placing fear and madness there.
The darkness, itself, might be fully sentient. After the sun sets, it blankets the land, poking and prodding into every space, listening to
secrets told in the anonymity of night, pursuing its own goals and ambitions. Perhaps it is darkness that decides to conquer the world.
Invading the daytime, and settling nature into an eternal slumber.
And then you have the darkness that exists within people, whether they embrace it, or try to overcome it. The anti-heroes of these
genres have souls imbued with shadows; shadows gathered from past traumas, or a darkness that has grown in them because of the
dark nature of the world in which they reside. Shadows born of regrets, frustration, anger, or thoughts of vengeance. Shadows that,
if they wish to conquer the evil in the world, they must face and confront. It might mean accepting them as part of who they are,
allowing themselves, ﬁnally, to sink into that dark part of themselves to get the job done. Even if it means that they may never emerge
from the darkness again. Or it might mean overcoming the darkness within, ﬁnding the light, the heroism, and the hope inside of their
hearts that they believed was extinguished long ago.
The darkness, the corruption and rot, is something that can creep into every aspect of your world. Not just the landscape, not just in
the deepest caverns and the thickest forests, but into every part of your world's culture. Dark, corrupt religions with sinister ambi-
tions, overbearing, oppressive governments with hostile agendas, an educational curriculum crammed with propaganda and teaching



hatred to children. The shadows might be secret societies with malevolent plans. They might be underground hives of monsters that
begin to claw their way out into the world.
Wherever the darkness and shadows exist, wherever they permeate, and whatever they conceal, they can be so much more than the
simple absence of light. They can be a metaphor for the corruption in your world, they can be sentient, with purpose of their own. They
can even be the thing that saves the world. And remember, you can’t always banish the darkness by just switching on a light.
Questions:
- What form does the darkness take in your physical world?
- What form does the darkness take in your society?

ENDLESS WARS
In horror, dark fantasy, and grimdark worlds, you expect things to be a bit grim. But what if it has always been that way? Without
reprise? What kind of effect would an endless war, spanning centuries, have on your world and the people that reside there?
Wars can take many forms, and begin for many reasons. Your world might be ﬁghting an endless ideological war, with clashing beliefs
and principles, and each side seeking to assert its world-view. Racial wars erupt from ancient hostilities between different races or
species, where historical grievances are woven deep into their cultural identities, making peace appear impossible. Territorial wars are
fought over lands rich in resources or strategic importance, with borders being constantly redrawn as kingdoms rise and fall. Divine
wars occur when deities and their zealous followers clash, tu_rning religious passion into apocalyptic crusades.
Wars cause profound geopolitical changes, reshaping both political boundaries and alliances, as well as the physical landscape. As
kingdoms and realms conquer and invade—pushing forward, retreating back—borders shift and move, redrawing maps over and over.
New alliances are forged while old ones crumble under the strain of continuous conﬂict. These wars might lead to the emergence of
new political entities, such as warlord states, militaristic regimes, and puppet governments appointed by conquering factions, placing
power balances into a state of constant ﬂux and instability.
Economically and socially, the impacts of ceaseless warfare can be devastating. Prolonged conﬂicts drain resources, stiﬂe economic
growth, and often lead to the establishment of war economies where production is predominantly geared towards sustaining the war
effort. Societally, the continuous state of war leads to massive population displacements, creating waves of refugees. It changes job
prospects, farming, education, as well as population numbers. It also results in low morale; as wars drag on, hope becomes harder to
hold onto.
Culturally, long-term wars embed a vein of militarism into society. Daily life adopts the norms and values of survival and defence,
signiﬁcantly altering cultural practices. Traits such as vigilance and physical strength are valued above more peaceful cu_ltu_ral expres-
sions. Over generations, this can lead to a society where war is a way of life, inﬂuencing literature, art, religion, and personal identities.
Of course, the war may be happening in a far and distant land. Or it might be a war fought only with politics, sanctions, and
negotiations. The day-to-day effect on your people would be different than on those trying to scrape a living on the edges of an active
battleﬁeld. But the effect wouldn't, necessarily, be less profound.
Even a distant war will require resources and soldiers. Perhaps the government has imposed laws of national service, requiring people
to complete a mandatory period in the military. The law might call up every male once they become recognised as an adult. It might
call up everyone with magical powers. Perhaps your character is approaching adulthood, or attempting to save their son from national



service. Maybe your character develops magic powers, and is forced to keep them secret to prevent being called to ﬁght. Maybe your
character's farm, factory, livelihood, or home is requisitioned for military purposes.
Whether the war is being fought at home or far away, whether it is fought with swords, guns, or political negotiations, it will have a
deep impact on the landscape and culture of your world. But just because war is all your characters have ever known in their lives, it
doesn't mean they have to accept things the way they are. It doesn't mean they won't ﬁght for peace.
Questions:
- What kind of war is being fought?
- Where is the war being fought?
- What impact has the war had on society?
- What impact does the war have on your characters?



THE WORLD IS DOOMED
Stories often reach a point of crisis just before their climactic moment. The crisis point is the dark before the dawn. It is when the main
conflict reaches its peak, presenting the protagonist with a seemingly insurmountable challenge. It's when everything is at its bleakest,
when it seems that all hope is lost. It's a decisive moment that forces the protagonist to make signiﬁcant choices that will determine
the outcome of the story.
A sense of impending doom gives your story a backdrop of tension and urgency, compelling your characters to confront their deepest
fears and moral dilemmas. In horror, dark fantasy, and grimdark, such a world magniﬁes themes of existential dread, human frailty,
and the struggle for survival against impossible odds. It challenges both your characters and readers to ﬁnd meaning and resilience in
the face of annihilation.
Perhaps your world has been doomed by an ancient curse rooted in long-forgotten histories and adversaries in search of vengeance.
Maybe apocalyptic prophecies, foretold by seers or inscribed in ancient texts, tumble your world towards an inescapable catastrophe.
Natural disasters, plagues, or magical calamities can all serve as immediate and tangible threats, disrupting the world's sense of order
and pushing societies to the brink.
Introducing the cause as a single antagonist—a dark god, a powerful sorcerer, or a malevolent entity from another realm—brings an
intimate aspect to the threat, as it comes with personal motivations or vendettas. Integrate these threats into the world's history and
lore to not only ground it in a believable context, but to give the looming danger a sense of primeval inevitability, of preordained fate.
It emphasises the sense that it can't be beaten, can't be stopped, raising the tension and the stakes ready for the climax of the story.
Of course, it might not be an outside force that threatens to bring about the world's destruction. It might not even be intentional. It
might be humans that have brought this terrible outcome upon themselves.
Climate change ﬁction, or 'c1i-ﬁ', has gained notable popularity in recent years as a subgenre of science-ﬁction that explores the impacts
of climate change on society, individuals, and the planet. Not only does cli-ﬁ tackle timely and urgent themes, reflecting real-world
environmental concerns and anxieties, it can humanise complex scientiﬁc data through storytelling in order to raise awareness and
inspire action. It might be rising sea levels that threaten your world, or widespread drought, disease, or crop failure. It might even be
humankind’s attempts to ﬁx things that doom them all.
The end of the world might not have a source of blame at all. There might not be anyone or anything that people can point to as the
cause. It might be nothing more than the changing of the seasons, the cycle of nature, the ongoing lifecycle of the world itself. Maybe
it's a celestial event; a particular alignment of the planets, solar expansion, a galactic collision, or a slow, millennia-long descent into a



black hole. The end of your world may have been predicted thousands of years ago, with every new generation knowing that they are
moving towards an end they cannot prevent. How might that show in their culture, in the ways they Live their lives?
The end of the world might seem inevitable and beyond prevention. Or it might be inevitable. But your characters don’t necessarily
need to stop the end of the world in order to succeed. They don't even need to stop it in order to ﬁnd some happiness. Some hope.
Perhaps your character learns to ﬁnd the joy in the present day, rather than musing a future that doesn't exist. Maybe they learn to love,
and allow themselves to be loved, letting go of the bitterness they feel about their approaching fate. They don't need to save the world,
to save themselves.
Questions:
- How is the world doomed?
- Is it preventable?
- What impact does the end have on society?
- What impact does the end have on your characters?



THERE'S ALWAYS HOPE
You don't need to give your readers a happy ending. In fact, in grimdark in particular, a happy ending would go against convention.
These stories seek to highlight themes showing the harsh realities of life and the often futile struggle against insurrnountable odds.
But that doesn't mean your story has to be devoid of all hope.
Hope can provide a much-needed counterbalance to the prevalent darkness of your story, motivating characters to keep ﬁghting
against overwhelming odds, and offering readers glimmers of light. A careful balance of hopeful moments contrast against the
bleakness, making the harsher, darker periods even more poignant and impactful, and highlighting the strength and resilience of the
human spirit.
Hope can serve as an important force to push your characters forward, supporting them through their toughest moments. It can
inspire them to face their challenges and withstand their hardships. Integrating hope into the narrative heightens the emotional
stakes, making your character's triumphs all the more satisfying, while making their losses all the more powerful and resonant for
your readers.
Hope might be found in a physical object; the discovery of an important relic, a ﬁeld of a rare medicinal herb, or a simple pebble given
from one friend to another as a symbol of friendship or a promise of loyalty. It might be the sight of a lush and tranquil valley hidden
among barren, hostile terrain, a secluded lake your characters can't help but dive into, or a stunning sunrise that they take a moment
to enjoy.
Not only do these glimmers of hope serve as a small yet potent reminder that not all is lost, but they give you a chance to explore
and deepen your characters, as well as the relationships between them. Enemies can become friends, friends can become lovers, or a
character can ﬁnd themselves aching for someone unexpected. Stories can be told, histories explored, and plans made. It doesn't need
to be an idle moment just for the sake of lightening the mood. You can make it work hard for you.
You may choose to include a character who embodies hope; an unyielding hero, a wise mentor, a deﬁant rebel leader. The resolve and
optimism these characters convey can be contagious, allowing them to lift the spirits of those around them. They will have crises of
conﬁdence, and they will have intemal conflicts to resolve, but by persevering through their personal trials, they not only take control
of their own destinies, but also illuminate a path for others, proving that even in the bleakest worlds, hope can thrive and steer mean-
ingful change.
In these genres, your characters aren't guaranteed a happily ever after. They might not even get a happy for now. But giving your
readers an entirely bleak and despairing ending runs the risk of them feeling unsatisﬁed, or even that they've wasted their time in



reading the book. Balancing a less than happy ending with an edge of hope for the future, allows readers to feel that things might just
turn out okay. And, sometimes, that's all that's needed.
Even if the protagonists eventually face defeat, small victories or enduring symbols can hint at a brighter tomorrow. Perhaps a young
survivor discovers an ancient book of knowledge, offering hope of rebuilding and learning from past mistakes. A revolution leader's
ﬁnal act of deﬁance could inspire a new generation to rise and continue the ﬁght for justice. The reemergence of new plant growth in
a desolate landscape can symbolize the renewing of the earth, giving hope for future survival. By weaving in these small but powerful
elements, you can acknowledge the current darkness while leaving the door open for future hope and redemption.

A WORD ON INFO DUMPING AND LEARNING CURVES
Once you have ﬁnished building your world, and you are ready to start writing your book, you need to consider how, and how much,
of the background information to include.
Don't think that you will be including every ounce of what you've worked on. You won't. You shouldn't. I know, I know, you worked
hard on it, but it wasn't wasted, even if it never makes it into your book. It helped you to understand your world, so that you can write
about it in an informed, attached, and immersive way. So that you can make it all the more real for your readers.
An ‘info dump’ is the term used for when a writer pours out information onto the page as if they are writing a history text book. It's dry,
it's dull and, more often than not, it's unnecessary and confusing.
I'm sure you will have heard the old adage ‘show don't tell’. This means that you should be showing your readers your worldbuilding,
through action and dialogue, not simply telling them via a historical lecture.
The absolute best way to teach your readers about your world is through action. This might be your character clashing with police, or it
may simply be them navigating the world. For example, if something in your fantasy world is absolutely normal, however far removed
it is from our world, if you character treats it, and reacts to it, as if it is entirely regular and everyday, then you are teaching your read-
ers about your world through action.
Say, for example, centaurs are a common sight in your world. If your character treats them with no surprise at all, talking to them as
if they are another human, then your readers learn that centaurs and humans live alongside one another equally. Or, perhaps your
character ridicules or bullies the centaurs. Or they treat them with respect, or fear. This is what you are teaching your readers about
what the norrn is in your world. Through action. This is the ideal way to show your worldbuilding.
It's not always so easy.
And so, the next best way is through dialogue. Again, avoid huge blocks of information. This is no different to info dumping, you're
simply letting the history lecture come out of a character's mouth. However, they can have a conversation with a friend about a histor-
ical aspect of the world, or a cultural aspect. A conversation. Not a lecture.
Sometimes, however, you need to break the rules. I'm not saying that you must never simply tell your readers information. Sometimes,
it's necessary. Sometimes, it's even the better option. But, do it with careful consideration, and do it sparingly. Rules are meant to be
broken, certainly in creative pursuits.



If you're concerned about whether or not you're getting the balance right, the best way is through the use of beta readers. Beta readers
read through early, pre-publication versions of your book, and give honest feedback that allows you to improve your story. If you've got
the balance wrong, beta readers can tell you.
Another way to learn this is through reading, reading, and reading. Take careful note of how other authors handle the dilemma. How
they get the balance right, and how they get it wrong.
The other way is simply through practice. The more you write, the more you drill down into your personal style and voice, the better
you are likely to get at it.
The way in which you give worldbuilding information to your readers also depends on the complexity of your world, and how different
it is to ours.
If you're writing about earth, whether in the present, past, or future, there are many things your readers will already know. They
understand about time, and seasons. They know the animals, the plants. They know what humans are like, and how they interact. The
learning curve of your world may be quite a gentle one.
Everything in your world that is different to our real world, adds to the learning curve of your book. Every mythical creature, every
imagined technology, every drop of magic, and every jargon word makes that curve a little bit steeper.
You want to ease your readers in. If, in chapter one, you expect them to learn everything about your world and its history, learn who
the characters are, and absorb their struggles and goals, they will be exhausted by the time they get to chapter two.
Tell them what they need to know. They don't need 5 million years worth of military history. They may need ﬂashes of it, but not the
entire thing. Be gentle with them. Don't make them do too much work, and don't leave them ﬂoundering around your story loaded
down with too much knowledge.
Again, these are things that you can learn and improve on with the help of beta readers, by reading, reading, reading, and by simply
practising your craft. You will ﬁnd your way, I promise, but I can't tell you how to do it because we are all different. And our stories are
different. And our voices are diﬁ‘erent.
You might write short, 50,000 word novels and leave a lot of the deeper worldbuilding out. You might write 1 50,000 word epics, with
readers who expect a much more immersive experience. Practice, experiment, and you'll ﬁnd the right balance for you, your books, and
your readers.



IDEAS DUMP
As you work your way through this book, you are bound to have ﬂashes of ideas popping into your mind. Character and story ideas,
that don't quite belong with the guidebook prompts.
Don't lose them; those little ﬂashes are important.
Instead, reserve a few notebook pages or create a document as something of an ideas dump. Some of these may never make it into your
ﬁnished book, but, you never know, you may be able to recycle them into other stories.
No idea is ever wasted...
